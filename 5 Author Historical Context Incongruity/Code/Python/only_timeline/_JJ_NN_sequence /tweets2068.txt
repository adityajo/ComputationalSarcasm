@patrickrife brewed in federal hill by yours truly‚Ä¶so baltimore

@PatrickRife toddy home brew, $34 on Amazon

@garminfitness thats the problem though, it never syncs when you want it to! It eventually does‚Ä¶.

@garminfitness Let me clarify - Garmin Express does not work. All it needs to be is a sync button, nothing else. Please fix this!

@GarminFitness your Garmin Connect product is soo baddd, it should not be released. All i want to do is sync my run and it never works #fail
