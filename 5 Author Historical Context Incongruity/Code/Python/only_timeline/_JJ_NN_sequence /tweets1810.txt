It is 1 am and people are still standing in line for pancakes! Smh Ain't nobody got time for that! ✋

I guess the problems are real now-a-days for a 3rd grader! Lmao

I have probably been in my bed for about 85% of my day! Being sick is for the birds 😒😷

The rare occasions that I actually watch tv I spend 1% of my time flipping through channels, and 99% of the time looking for the remote!

Well 5 am sure did come way before I wanted it to! 😒🙅☕

5 am is going to come way to soon! I can smell the coffee now! 😒☕

I have to be up at 5 for clinicals and am awoken to "shots" blaring loudly from upstairs! 😡

@AP_Bangz Ummm sir! It's per gallon I asked! I'm not that dumb!

I need to learn to pack better....smh. I think I have packed everything I don't need and the 1 thing I want is back home :'(

In Venezuela gas is free!! If it wasn't so scary there, I would be there!!

I just might move to Ecuador! Gas here is $1.29 per gallon!!!

Ate the most amazing icecream I have ever had today by far! I could definitely get used to Ecuador! :)

Successfully made it to Ecuador! I am beyond tired due to running on 4 hours of sleep! I am about to be knocked out for a long while!

@DANK_GRIND_HARD shut up dank, your insults are not funny!

@DANK_GRIND_HARD dank, take your ass to bed!

If something matters to someone then they will prove it. If not, then they never really cared in the first place.

In order to grow as an individual we have to make changes.I thought I would regret the decision I made and I would be proven wrong, but no.

My I'm so freaking excited my best friends are coming down face!! This weekend is about to get CRAZY!!… http://t.co/WZH9B7PWWX

If this tornado decides to hit, can it at least wait until burlesque is over!? 😁😝

The whole panhandle is under a tornado watch😱😱 I definitely cannot handle this!

@SSaenz_OF you and I both!

@SSaenz_OF that's what I was thinking too bad the whole panhandle is like under it, screwed either way we go!

@SSaenz_OF I feel the same way!! I am home alone and freaking out!!

@ochomcdowell25 I hate you. We are not friends anymore. Least I remembered to call you back unlike some people.

I love to be able to put smiles on other people's faces! It just brightens my day! 😊😃

Shoot! I forgot to call will back.....don't be mad😁😁😁

It's too early to be functioning right now! 😣

I hate when I wake up and can't fall back asleep 😒

Waking up to 27 missed phone calls, and 18 new texts.....yea I'm definitely not ready to deal with that bull shit again today!

Idk what to do...I haven't been put in this position in awhile! 😒😰😖

Ughh I definitely need to go for a drive or a run or something just to get my mind from the present!

I am cracking up at @kdz4409 #tbt 😂😂

I know he is not being rude to me!? You're the only creep on my TL right now so what else am I suppose to look at!?

I need Will to go to sleep and get off my TL with all his baby making nonsense! They make water for the thirst you are experiencing, geesh!

Sad when you realize there is no longer a friendship between you and a person you used to be so close too! Oh well, I guess that's life.

'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line, I am not a girl that could ever be defined! 🎶

Hot tub time?? I think yes! 🎶👌🙏

I am finally all DONE with finals!! hello summer, you couldn't of came at a better time! 😊💙👌☀👙🍻

2 days, 2 finals and I'm done, 😖😖 I will be beyond relieved!

Why does my mind insist on thinking about a million things when all I wanna do is sleep!?! 😠👎😒

Omg, my best friend is truly sick! She just used the "H" word implying hospital. If anyone knows Morgan they know she's terrified of them!😱

It's a fire! https://t.co/AYix2NdvTv

Tell my dad that my friend is pregnant, his response: "I bet she had to go open up the phone book to find her baby daddy.". 😱😱😱

@mzCarriebby 😂😂😂😂 I'll pray for you! 🙏

If you told me at this start of this year I would be staying in and watching movies on dead day I would laugh in your face, but I'm doing it

Yes @_RunDolo13 thinks I'm a thug! #score thanks @EastyBeasty90 for teaching me your lingo!

You go to bed lol. I do what I want!

@_RunDolo13 ✋ I'm up

I swear my roommate is never home

@_RunDolo13 Eghhh better not! I would rather not get frost bite! p.s Morgan is going to be mad you tweeted but didnt answer her call lol

Only guys from jarret would be outside at this time playing some type of game. Are you retarded!? It's 36 degrees, too cold for that!

Definitely my life this week and next! #finals #nursing #almostout http://t.co/QItzxyxPc5

RT @mzCarriebby: Boss man is talking about a staff retreat/training 😳 I'm not camping with the ppl I work with.

It never fails, every time  I lay down on the rare occasions to watch tv there is absolutely nothing on tv! 😠

When my mom calls at 12:30 at night I automatically answer by asking what happened. Nothing apparently, she just got home from friends 😳😳😳

@YAD_christdj379 I found your keys at the AC and have them.

@TBrollier yay! Well except I wont be back until mid July but hopefully I can see you!

@TBrollier yes! I am most definitely looking forward to that! Where are you now?

@TBrollier yes I do! That's good! I will be better once finals are over!

@TBrollier Travis! Oh how I miss your face! How are you?

Work is the last place I want to be right now 😒

I know that this is a silly fear, but it's something I think about!

One of my most fearful nightmares almost came true just now: As I was eating on some almonds I started choking with noone around to save me😳

Get home after being gone for a week and my bed is unmade? Ummm I make my bed every morning, wth!? 😳😳

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 😷

I hope Morgan is ready for this damn cat because it has got some lungs on it and has kept me up most of the night!

I give it a 10, a freaking 10!!! 😂😂😂 #varsityblues

Man there is just so much going on in the huge city of Memphis, I just don't know where to start! 😁 #saidnoonever

@lilMusick I believe that! I already do that now! I also always look at people for abnormalities or to see if I could place an IV in them.

@lilMusick I have found this happening a lot here lately! Lol

@ochomcdowell25 we will! Don't worry I will be running it in your face when they do! #hater

@kallietaylor3 plan B: if you don't move, I will be going there part of the summer to visit and you will come here!

@kallietaylor3 okay, plan A: you move here and get your degree in PT while I'm in nursing school, than we graduate and go to Hawaii!

@kallietaylor3 you can!! I have a plan in progress ready!

I miss my beautiful best friends face soooo stinkin' much! Leave icky Dallas and just come back already! 😊😃 @kallietaylor3

I hate when you barely turn the heat up in the shower and it feels like it increases by 60 deg. and your best friend becomes the back wall 😡

I think I was literally offered weed like every 5 steps! 😳

Man, I'm pretty sure after today I could smuggle at least a solid 10 lbs of weed to Mexico if I wanted!

I cannot stand when people use the phrase, "I hate my life." get over it! 😡 Cherish what you have because others aren't as lucky!

Hearing a bear outside my window before I go to sleep is definitely something I could of passed on! 😳😱 #scared

The dumbest moment of the night definitely goes to me. 😒 Im sitting on the phone and said blink once for yes two for no. #stupid #blonde

The fact that will doesn't answer the phone when I call 😠😠

Coming through my door and acting as quiet as possible as if I'm still in high school and don't want to get caught😂 some things never change

The gifts I just received from my brother, sister-in-law, and nephew&gt;&gt;&gt;😍☺👍

I am starving 😁😒

I slept a total of 13 hours last night and it has never felt so amazing before in my life! 😊
