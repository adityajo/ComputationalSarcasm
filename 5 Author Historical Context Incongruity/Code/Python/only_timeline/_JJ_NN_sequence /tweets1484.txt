OK you #Blackhawks I am NOT impressed /w your game thus far. Moments of brilliance...but you've got some work to do! #CHIvsANA #NHLplayoffs

Spending Mother's Day alone w/o a Mom or children is not so much fun, so I'm spending it /w The Avengers. #MissMyMom http://t.co/rQIAersQaJ

@radiomccord The White Album is one of my faves...but so is Sgt. Pepper. I can see how she'd mix 'em up. #Sarcasm #OhMom

Chicken noodle soup...without the soup for dinner. #OneOfMyFaves #ComfortFood #RemindsMeOfMom

25yrs ago today my Mom became my guardian angel. I lover her &amp; miss her every day &amp; hope that she is proud of her daughter #Heartache #Love

Morning...sometimes you are just too early! #Just5MoreMinutesMom

"There are moments in life when you miss someone SO much that you want to pick them from your dreams &amp; hug them for real" Happy B-day Mom!

@JennyMcCarthy Without a doubt my Mom. She passed away when I was 12. #MissHer #JennyAsks

Watching the TV /w the kiddos...Adventure Time on the Cartoon Network ain't your Momma's cartoon... #Weird #MissTheOldDays

Attempted to do a little Portuguese cooking today for my BF. Vo's sausage &amp; potatoes. "Just like Mom's"...I think he was just being polite.

@Patrycja_Palus Stupid indeed! Can't wait for the rumours to get back to Mom &amp; Dad :s #ExplainingToDo

There are times, even as a grown up that a girl just needs her Mom. I wish mine was here now. #GuradianAngel #3amWish

Just realized today would have been my Mother's 65th birthday. Happy Birthday Mom...I love you! #MissYouEveryday

Really missing my Mom today. There are times when a girl needs her Mama...no matter how old she is. #GuardianAngel #Love
