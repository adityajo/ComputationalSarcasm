@NatWest_Help Then, if the AIP declines, the client doesn't get their hopes up. A decline is ok, but to get a pass and then decline is poor.

@NatWest_Help .... and my biggest gripe is you take around 10 days to advise me. Surely your AIP engine should pick up credit issues?

@NatWest_Help Probably not. 3 of the last 4 mortgage applications I have placed have passed AIP but declined on credit later.....

I have never felt so empty and desolate. Many dark thoughts.

Every time I hear high heels walk past my window I look up in hope, only to see a lipstick kiss on the glass #heartbroken #sad

Nat West - I don't need your shit. Don't tell me I haven't done something when I am looking at it on your screen.

Brain still fucked up from a dream I had last night. It really made me question everything I am going through. Feel really messed up ATM.

After a 5 month affair I am back with my family, trying to make a go of things. I am turning to Twitter to keep me on the right path.

I think I have made one massive, life changing mistake.

Never have I felt so shit and so relieved at the same time.

Who invented Sunday dinner? Chicken isn't for roasting. It should go in wraps or a stir fry.

Using the same analogy as earlier - I have won the lottery, now found my ticket, but realise I can never spend any of the winnings.

I feel like I have won the lottery, but lost my ticket.

@infromthetrent I agree, other than start with Paterson in for Radi. #NFFC

It's supposed to be getting warmer? Really?

Dug myself out of the hole I got myself into. So why, this morning, do I want to revisit the hole and jump straight back in?

Frantically trying to get myself out of the hole I am in.

I admit I was wrong about Abdoun at #NFFC After the Millwall game I questioned his ability (although never doubted his desire).

In a hole - I must stop digging! #rightplacewrongtime

@infromthetrent I'll be there, belting out Mist Rolling in from the Trent, from the Upper Trent End #NFFC #COYR

@Official_NFFC Some days I have to pinch myself to think that we actually won the European Cup. Twice. #NFFC

@imagineeringdis I know how you feel. I'm in the mood for riding Spaceship Earth. Or Tower of Terror. But sadly, I'm in England.

@TheDisneyBlog 2 hrs &amp; 40 mins for Toy Story Mania. Was the day I arrived and it was due to close for maintenance for the rest of my stay.

After 3 glorious days, torrential rain due tomorrow with massive drop in temperature. So what am I watching now? The Day After Tomorrow!

@sportchippers Any update on Guedioura?  Would be gutted to see him go. I hoped today we would be adding to the squad, with no-one leaving.

Please can someone give me some inspiring words about how problems are their to test us etc. At the moment they are just BIG problems!

@infromthetrent It's great to think that, whatever happens today, we are focused on adding to the squad rather than worried about selling.

@SkySportsNews Is his hair falling out again?

@AnnaSianFeeney Perhaps we were just unlucky &amp; you jinxed Derby?!  However, until promotion is secured I request you stay in on match days!

@Attractions They had them when I was there in 2010, but I remember then the only option was $14.99 for the duration of your stay.

Can we go back to golden goals in football?  I'm knackered, and this is the third game I've seen this week to go to extra time!

@SkySportsNews He always thought he was the greatest player on the planet. I'm surprised he isn't expecting move to Barca!

@TheDisneyBlog Invite me over!  It's one day after my 50th (hence the Twitter name!)

@DisneyParks I also like the story telling frog in the queue, although you only ever see his silhouette.

@DisneyParks I love the geese, just before going inside to see Brer Rabbit for the first time - 'How do you do? Pleased to meet you!'.

@TheDisneyBlog I always have the hopper option (most tickets bought in the UK include it anyway) to access both morning and evening EMHs.

Sorry to say, but I don't think Abdoun cuts it as a #NFFC player. Just not quite good enough at this level. Can't fault his desire though.

@SarahMillican75 It depends whether or not you are on stage!

@infromthetrent @capitalone_cup I'm there!  #COYR

Why do people say 'I haven't got time to tell you about it' then proceed to tell you chapter &amp; verse.

@43SquareMiles @lurkyloo I want to go on the balloon attraction!

@AnnaSianFeeney Instant anti-fed up therapy - find a Sky Bet Championship table &amp; look at the top. Feeling any better?

@wdwfacts Ice cream at Beaches &amp; Cream, a boat on Bay Lake, and a leisurely walk around World Showcase.

@nascar99 @wdwfacts It's Horizons, the long time favourite of many old school Epcot fans. Sadly no longer there.

It bugs me when people say 'It's not a problem' when, to them, it clearly is.

@imagineeringdis It's a great ride but the element of chance as to whether or not you get wet is spoiled, as everyone gets soaked.

IT - you have cost me more money and time today than you have made me. I am going home almost 2 hours late and am ready to explode.

Colleague's first day of holiday, it's not even 9am, and already the problems have started. Looks like I'm in for a fun 2 weeks!

In summer, I can taste the rain. #alienantfarm #aaf #movies #howtrue

@TheDisneyBlog Ice cream. And take a Sea Raycer out on the water.

@wdwfacts The monorail - specifically between TTC &amp; Epcot after dark. I treat that as an attraction in it's own right!

3 years ago today since I last arrived at #waltdisneyworld  I still keep my keycard and park pass in my wallet. Wish I was back there today.

@TheDisneyBlog Ice Cream Sundae from Wetzels Pretzels at DTD, Sea Raycer on Bay Lake, and as many EMHs as I can manage!

@wdwfacts Does Beaches &amp; Cream count as a restaurant?  I can make ice cream into a meal!

I'm sensing summer could be over.

@TheDisneyBlog Robin Hood - a ride like Harry Potter at IoA, fully immersed into Sherwood Forest.

@wdwfacts Studios (although I do love Expedition Everest)

Didn't sleep well as daughter in hospital today for an operation. I don't usually wish days away,but I'll be much happier when today is over

@TheDisneyBlog Well every visit I'm there for a Dulce Double Dazzler. Never managed to find one in the UK so it's a 'must do' evert trip.

@SarahMillican75 These days, if you're posh, you have fish in your bowl too! (If you're not posh, use the pond at the local park).

Just seen a car with the number plate M155 BJJ. I wonder what she's like in bed?!

After 9 years away I am once again a #NFFC season ticket holder! I've also bagged myself a ticket for tonight #COYR

Why is it, even if I haven't particularly enjoyed a holiday, I still get emotional when it's time to leave?

‚Äú@ReedyCreekRadio: Just posted a photo @ Disney's Boardwalk http://t.co/LIMwBXslmH‚Äù.  I can just picture Walt leaning on the railings!

Not sure why my family come on holiday!  Lovely weather, so they watch TV and go on iPad whilst I sunbathe, see the sights and go for a run.

Torquay - I've not seen so many freaks of human nature since I was last in Kettering.

@designingdisney @plazagardens I have that too - and A Day at Epcot. I love the recently departed SpectroMagic footage.

@TheDisneyBlog ...to ride Test Track. It's great to come out of the show building on a warm night and see all the lights along the track.

Done it!  Up to date before I go on holiday. 3 weeks work squeezed in 6 mad, long days.

‚Äú@WaltDisneyWorld: What's the best part of Tomorrowland for you?  http://t.co/U0huQUtrIC‚Äù. PeopleMover for me.

10 days work to do in 3 days, before I break up for holiday. #stressed

@UniversalORL Incredible Hulk.

@DisneyParks @waltdisneyworld The EMHs in the evenings.  It was summertime, so staying out til 3am at MK &amp; 2am at Epcot was awesome.

@JOWAR1 @sarahmillican75 If that is on the back of a car, I saw that car on Trent Bridge in Nottingham last night!

@DisneyParks To visit all Disney parks is on my bucket list. I've done WDW &amp; DLP, so Hong Kong, Tokyo or Shanghai would be fine for me!

@WaltDisneyWorld The Laughing Place. Also, in the queue, I like the silhouette of the frog on his rocking chair telling the stories.

Just wasted 90 minutes (that I don't have to waste) going too see a client that wasn't there. #rude

@TheDisneyBlog Ice cream at Beaches and Cream, shopping at Downtown Disney, and a stroll around World Showcase in the evening.

@DisneyState @touringplans I was there in '10 &amp; used EMH most mornings and nights (with park hopping) - Was sometimes a 8am til 3am day.

Right now I want to go to the Hotel California. #eagles

@imagineeringdis As long as they keep the same soundtrack - I love that music.

@wdwmagic Is it going to be staying as Honey I Shrunk the Kids, or re-themed?

@wdwfacts Epcot - and I'd make it the last 4 hours of an EMHs night in the summer.

@WDWDowntown I disagree.They are the most magical time-for getting to parks early and get in some serious ride time before it gets too busy.

@43SquareMiles @hintofspy It always amazes me how they find people small enough to wear the duck costumes.

Is it too much to ask to win enough on the lottery to never work again, and always have gorgeous weather like today? #demanding

Any chance of tomorrow's Wimbledon final being played once the sun has gone down, so I can maximise my time outside?

When the weather is like it is today I a) wish I didn't work Saturdays, and b) wish I didn't work indoors. #careerchange?

@loumongello Dulce Split Dazzler - my favourite ice cream in the world. Always have to go there to have one whenever I come over.

@StanCollymore @Official_NFFC In over 30 years of following #NFFC that game at London Road was one of the biggest highlights. Thanks Stan.

I'm not religious, but someone has to be thanked for the combination that is hot days and gorgeous women #summeratlast

Happy Independence Day to all my friends in the USA.

@imagineeringdis I think I'd have to go for a Doom Buggy, or a lift cage from ToT.

@imagineeringdis Forget merchandise. Can I buy the PeopleMover?

If anyone else were as wrong in their job as weather forecasters, they would be sacked. You only need them to forecast the weather......

@Attractions I'm gutted. My favourite WDW parade - much better than Electrical Parade IMO. Brought a tear to my eye watching this :(

If what I say isn't clear, how come everyone else gets it?

@NottmForestNews I'll give him 2 months.

@infromthetrent If only he had kept his ego in check. He could still be playing Championship (possibly even Premiership) football #sillyboy

@JohnBishop100 Early morning. It will boost your metabolism for the day.

In the space of a couple of minutes I've wanted to be at a Ponderosa, have a summer hol in a lakeside cabin, and go to Islands of Adventure.

@TheDisneyBlog I'd make the PeopleMover trackless, like Mystic Manor, and separate the cars so each can revolve around 360 degrees.

@TheDisneyBlog ....to visit every Disney theme park in the world. I also want to see Walt's stars on Hollywood Boulevard.

@43SquareMiles I think PeopleMover needs an update - make it trackless like Mystic Manor, and let each cab rotate through 360 degrees.

@wdwfacts Rented a Sea Raycer from the Polynesian. Took it across Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon. Got a good look at Discovery Island.

‚Äú@BBCBreaking: "If you're not prepared to learn English, your benefits will be cut," UK chancellor tells claimants‚Äù About time too.

If you get your head in the right place, Louis Armstrong was right. #wonderfulworld

@imagineeringdis I thought you meant a feature length computer animated feature movie about a rat. Still, the food looks good!

Today, I have a heavy heart - thinking about good times in the past that can never happen again. #memories

If no-one minds, can I win the ¬£150m euro lotto on Tuesday?  I don't mind paying for the ticket.

I sometimes think I was born in the wrong country. #americaninanenglishbody

@Attractions Nothing says you've arrived in Florida like driving down I4 and seeing the first attraction billboard.

And, Nationwide, whilst I'm at it, why take 4 weeks to make a decision that you is based on documents you have held since day 1?

@HenryColeTV Your trips across the US are the best programs on TV. I'm planning a road trip thru all 48 mainland States. Your trips inspire!

I need to get away. I love my family, and have a good job, but I just need some time and space. I think I need a motorbike road trip.

@SarahMillican75 I'm not there, but shall enjoy it telepathically.

@ThemeParkNews It may have been 1980 then. It was definitely before '81 - I thought it was in the late 70's. Thanks.

@ThemeParkNews I'm sure I went to Alton Towers in the 1970s when they only had the gardens and Corkscrew. Is my memory correct?

@TheDisneyBlog I want to be Jim!

I. Am. So. Tired.

@DisneyFactsPage Which begs the question, If there were no guests at DL/WDW how crowded would it be with security and other CMs?

@DisneyState I wish you could get the feeds that they put into the hotel rooms direct to your TV at home!

I'll get the old photo albums out the loft later and will add some photos to my tweeted memories of #20yearsagotoday

So, #20yearsagotoday we flew from Birmingham UK to Orlando Intl, picked up a Hyundai Accent, and stayed at the Delta Orlando Resort.

In memory of this first #waltdisneyworld trip together, over the next 21 days I will tweet what we were doing #20yearsagotoday

Just realised that 20 years ago today was the first time I took my wife to USA &amp; #waltdisneyworld  Makes me quite emotional #20yearsagotoday

@NottmForestNews Apart from the Fergie one, I live and breathe all the others. #NFFC #ForesttilIdie

@DisneyState They did a morning EMH when I was last there in 2010. It was great to get the headline slides done &amp; be out before it got busy.

@DisneyState @i_planvacations It's also a great place to go real early in the morning to watch the turtles - and the glow from Epcot car lot

Ok weather - if you could just stay like this til October/November I'll buy you a present.

Tell you what world-how about I work for free? I'm sure my complaining client would not lecture for free if his pupils didn't take an exam.

@TheDisneyBlog Ice cream and cookie sandwich - where a big scoop of ice cream is sandwiched between 2 choc chip cookies.

@43SquareMiles I hope you brought enough sunscreen with you on your trip! #englishweather

@43SquareMiles It's the Millennium Bridge. When it was built it swayed with the resonating of people crossing, so it had to be strengthened.

Back to work today after 3 days off. Not really what I want to be doing!

Congratulations to all @DisneyParks @Disney Cast Members for making #Disney24 what it is. It doesn't happen without you.

@DisneyParks It's 6:15am in the UK, so guess 1:15am with you, and it looks from the webcam like the Electrical Parade is on. Parades at 1am?

@wdwfacts Definitely wish I could be there. Having managed 19 hours on my last trip with EMHs, I'm sure I could do 24 (with plenty of cola)!

@ThemeParkNews For me,that might be an issue for Sea World-after all the hype I was expecting amazing and jaw-dropping, but fun is about it.

@ExperianExperts .... I had to contact by email or online form. This is for a client of mine who has no computer, so sent from mine.....

@ExperianExperts Hi. On your website, Contact Us, Consumer Enquiries, Online Contact Form. When I called was told as had Stat Report only...

@wdwfacts @disneyparks Mid summer. I love the weather, and the later EMH.

@TheDisneyBlog I've always rented a car, even if staying on site. Meant I can stay out til early hours on EMH nights without hassle.

@NottmForestNews I bet he wished he had kept his ego in check,and concentrated on his game. Perhaps a non-league club will give him a trial!

@wdwfacts Mickey's PhilharMagic. Although I guess the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train might win once it is completed.

It's good to dream.

@BBCBreaking Well I, as a parent, motion for a vote of no confidence on the teachers and headteachers of this country #useless

@wdwfacts Tower of Terror. I was a bit disappointed with Toy Story Mania.

@wdwfacts Is it Big Thunder Mountain?

@WaltDisneyWorld If I'm by myself it's Expedition Everest, but if I'm with my family it's the Safari.

‚Äú@Attractions: RT @patrickzfilms: Squidward loves me! http://t.co/eEWlGtI4aq‚Äù. I'm not sure Squidward and love go in the same sentence.

@TheDisneyBlog I think a marathon duck race should take place - through Splash Mountain!!  Or, for hardcore ducks, Kali River Rapids!!

I am really missing America at the moment. I need to arrange a trip - even if it's just for a few days.

@wdwfacts Yak &amp; Yeti at Animal Kingdom. Not the best selection, but I just love the food!

It's here!!  @MensHealthUK Dirty Weekend Full Mucker!  Just about to leave home ready for 11am start. Can't wait. #bringiton

@sportchippers I had a dream last night that #NFFC beat Leicester away 8-1 in the playoff first leg. (And they scored first!)

@DisneyParks Expedition Everest - although I am attracted to the Yak &amp; Yeti!

All I want to do is get on with my work. Please can everyone stop asking for favours or interrupting me. Thanks.

@wdwfacts Epcot - I love the atmosphere of Future World at night.

@wdwfacts I love it so much I have it as my lock screen!

@BBCBreaking Is she going to announce the new Man Utd manager?

@sportchippers If only #NFFC had beaten them in that FA Cup tie in '90 it would save all the over reaction we are going to be bombarded with

@NottmForestNews I don't think the scale of Clough's initial achievements at #NFFC are fully recognised......

@TheDisneyBlog I'm in the UK - about 3 seconds on my iPhone.

@wdwfacts Is that taken from on top of Small World? Or is it further back - Haunted Mansion?

@ThemePark If I could get a Visa to live over there, I'd happily drive a resort bus all day.

@43SquareMiles ....... Do I watch Bambi, Cinderella or Lilo &amp; Stitch whilst enjoying them?  (Am I really 41 years old????)

@WaltDisneyWorld That would be mad!!  I would experience every attraction, parade, show - and try to do some twice.

@WaltDisneyWorld Tough one - it's my favourite park and I love most of the attractions. I think I'd have to say Spaceship Earth.

This is unbearable. I am at work, and picking up scores as they change. Wish I was at the City Ground - just need to let off some pressure.

@Official_NFFC My appt has cancelled, so I can now follow the first half on-line/twitter. Wish I was there. #COYR #NFFC

@sportchippers What about being at work til 4 - I may not get to know the result til then!!

@ThemeParkNews Gringotts-but I am keen to see the effects used in the Hogwarts Express to immerse you in the journey,rather than the backlot

@wdwfacts Just the last one, but I would never stay off resort again. Main plus for me is the extra magic hours.

@infromthetrent I think a lot will depend on how Saturday ends up. Hopefully all the squad buy into Billy's plans.

@Disney "Wrong lever. I don't even know why we have that lever!". Watched that film a few days ago, for the first time in years.

If Ramos carries on with leading with his elbows he won't last the second half #realmadrid

@ThemeParkNews I've been to 6, and 3 of the other 4 are on my 'bucket list'.

@MTVTheValleys Get off my twitter. Why do I want to see a picture of 4 gay sheep shaggers? Carnage? Look about as tough as loo roll!!

@UniversalORL Summer. I love the hot, balmy, stormy Florida summers.

@DisneyD23 It's on my bucket list to see this. Am I right in thinking Walt has 3 stars?

@ajhmurray I agree. There was something about Miss Pond.

@Official_NFFC Massive game today lads. I know you'll do us proud, whatever the result. #COYR #NFFC

@ThemeParkNews I am a fan but only to lower the queues at other attractions. I do like the parades, but am past waiting for hours for them.

2 weeks til @MensHealthUK Full Mucker!  It's 5:30am - time for a 12 mile training run before work #motivation

@SarahMillican75 I bet your fella still likes to play along with them though.

@wdwfacts Almost impossible to choose, but if I had just one day at one park I would say Epcot.

@Disney With the song 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight'. I find it quite emotional.

@idylarocks @waltdisneyworld I agree. Now they just look like 3D green models. Then they were crafted and the roughness gave them character.

@43SquareMiles My oh my what a wonderful day - I think I'll 'borrow' that for my lock screen!! (It is my favourite MK ride)

@wdwfacts Definitely. I'd get rid of my iPod and have that on 24/7.

One day, on my day off, I'm going to do what I want to do.

I fear that JLS splitting up will only reverse the trend of reducing violent crime. Picture all those angry fans rampaging thru our cities.

@wdwfacts Pleasure Island.

@SarahMillican75 It will make a ball with all your hair that you chew - and you will die.

I just have a feeling today is going to be a good day #hopeimright

I am more stressed about today's game than I have for a long time #NFFC #COYR

@wdwfacts The Haagen Dazs place in Downtown Disney (I bet I spelt it wrong!)

@MrDDyer I bet you would!

@DisneyParks I'm torn between Rock'n'Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror for thrills, but One Man's Dream holds a special place in my heart.

@designingdisney I'm in!!  Where shall I meet you?

#RIPMaggie #dingdongthewitchisdead   I have no opinion one way or the other - just trying to please everyone today.

@ThemeParkNews Hi. Answer to the question I put out earlier, from @TheDisneyBlog - it is both design and state law, hence no effect at WDW.

@TheDisneyBlog Quick question - how are they open at WDW but closed in DL? I appreciate the fire extinguishers and forms will be a local....

@ThemeParkNews I guess the fire extinguishers, forms etc were a local issue, but I would have though the building would be the same.....

C'mon Spurs. I'm knackered and want to get off to bed.

@TWDCjobs A VIP escort.If not, anything that involves being outside and covers the entire WDW property (bus driver, security etc). #DreamJob

@ajhmurray I predict that in 5-8 years he will not be a world famous millionaire, thereby proving his invention is a failure.

@infromthetrent Wish I could, but got to look after my daughter. Still, I'm giving my support through ITV4!  #NFFC #COYR

FA Youth Cup Semi-Final on ITV4 now. #NFFC #COYR

@SarahMillican75 Is there anything sexual in that tweet?

@TheDisneyBlog ....in merchandising, TV, movies etc. I can't think of anyone else who has touched the world in such a way #hero

@TheDisneyBlog It amazes me how much one man has changed the world. Even non-Disney fans must come across his name several times daily....

If Kim Jong-un has a cause to start a war with anyone, it should be his hairdresser. #bowlhead

I'm in an office with 2 women trying to 'out cough' each other, almost as if they want to show who is the most ill.

@Official_NFFC I was there!!  What a great day out it was, and started a great few years of return trips to Wembley. #happydays

Anyone in the Twitterverse want to come and help with all the jobs I've got to do today?  Sunday=day of rest?!?!?!

@WaltDisneyWorld I love mine trains at night - makes them much more atmospheric.

@SarahMillican75 Which is the long story of "I smell..and I am..pointless"

@wdwfacts It might not be a for a meal, but my favourite place is the Hagaan Dazs place, for a Dulce Dazzler (I think that's it's name!)

Mick Philpott - I hope you are beaten up every single day you are in jail, you sick bastard.

@43SquareMiles I need a suggestion for an Easter Sunday movie. I have a the following saved and ready to watch, and you're the movie man....

IT Company-Apparently my hard drive could crash at any time &amp; I could lose everything.Funny how it was fine on Tues before they touched it.

IT company-clearly the return of my computer by 9am wasn't going to happen.However,when you then say 11am why is it still not here at 11:13?

IT people - don't take my computer on my day off promising to have it back this morning, to now tell me i can't have it til after Easter.

@TheDisneyBlog I think disabled guests like to be treated as able bodied, but then throw in the disability card when it suits them.

I have so much in today that the timings have to be perfect. Overrun anywhere and my day is shot!

@wdwfacts I remember the day exactly - 20th July 1979. #veteran

Today I'm going to ignore everything my boss says. I'm calling it #vettelday

‚Äú@DisneyParks:  ∫I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse. ∫ - Walt Disney‚Äù

Just read my last tweet - I am sexting my wife whilst my daughter is having her art lesson. Daughter is not sexting my wife. #verywrong

@sarah_cawood Stay I'm bed and hug your two men.

Nationwide BS - does the BS stand for bull shit?  That is what I have been fed for the past 3 months about a client's application.

@Disney I'm tidying my kitchen, so the Sorcerer's Apprentice from Fantasia is probably most appropriate right now.

@danhardymma ¬£80 a week for 3 people at Tesco. Which is no fucking use to you over there, but you asked the question so I answered.

What the fuck does that Inter sub look like? Rat's tail and gum shield?  #ponce

‚Äú@wdwfacts: http://t.co/WiH7kFHBiM   Walt Disney World "Way Back Machine"‚Äù. I would loved to have been there and involved,right at the start

Roy Keane on ITV clearly has no issues with upsetting Fergie or the #mufc fans.

I guess eating a whole tub of Ben &amp; Jerry's Baked Alaska is not a preferred diet when trying to increase fitness #sundaytea

@ajhmurray I think the kettle was scared by the sign.

@tom_bricker Awesome. Epcot at night is my favourite part of WDW. I need to her back over there soon.

@wdwfacts It certainly looks more imposing like that.

@UniversalORL The Incredible Hulk coaster.

@loumongello Fantasia. I've played both and just find Fantasia more magical.

@wdwfacts Is it The Land?

@infromthetrent 2-0, and I think the first will be an OG, deflected from a Reid free kick. Sorry I can't be more specific! #NFFC #COYR

@loumongello 20,000 Leagues. It is the first attraction I remember from my first visit back in '79.

So Nationwide, you are within your timescales but were you actually going to call me? I reckon if I didn't call you I would be still waiting

Nearly every company I have had dealings with today have pissed me off. I am in danger of exploding. Everyone, sort your shit out.

TGIF!

85 days til @MensHealthUK Dirty Weekend.  Training moving up a notch, so I should really go to bed before big kettlebell session tomorrow.

@SarahMillican75 Isn't biscuit cake just an overcooked cake?

Anyone know if the Vatican are using a recruitment agency for their vacancies. I need to know where to send my CV.

@ajhmurray Who does the Pope give his resignation letter to? It's not as if his boss is usually in the office #PopeResignation

@designingdisney @loumongello @TheDisneyBlog Morning followees. Off to see Wreck It Ralph with my daughter. #bigkidexcitement

@2Manhattans @Disney @wdwfacts @43SquareMiles @WaltDisneyWorld  Morning followees.Off to see Wreck It Ralph with daughter. #bigkidexcitement

All this about Gazza. After almost 22 years I'm still bitter about the attacks on Parker and Charles in the FA Cup final. Have no sympathy.

As a #NFFC fan I am not too upset we lost today. I feel for SoD and the way he has been treated, so am accepting he put one over us today.

Just had a McDonalds. When I turned the TV down I'm sure I heard the burger 'neigh'.

@MensHealthUK 5 from 12, which I'm happy with.

If you could make models of the EastEnders characters, would your have a kit-Kat?

I reckon this match fixing/betting ring investigation should have a word with the Burkina Faso v Ghana referee #africacupofnations

@SarahMillican75 If they have been up there since Christmas no wonder they are bad.

@infromthetrent I'd love to see BD back. But if he had issues with the 'acquisitions panel' before, how will he be with the current owners?

@loumongello I'm split - Adventureland in the day, Frontierland in the evening and night.

@43SquareMiles ....which hotel are you at?  I stayed at the Newport Bay.

@43SquareMiles I must admit, if I was at DLP I'd miss the SuperBowl too. Only been to DLP once (despite living in UK yet been to WDW 5x)....

@43SquareMiles If you're still in Europe tomorrow you'll have the Superbowl experience I have - up all night &amp; a very tired Monday at work!

@sportchippers I hoped it was going to be at the City Ground.

@GarethADaviesDT @carl_froch @mikkelkessler I was hoping it was going to be at the City Ground :(

@WaltDisneyWorld There used to be a cart at the end of Sunset Boulevard, near Tower of Terror. If it's still there, that's my #1

@wdwfacts Physically about 3000 miles. Emotionally, I'm there every day.

This may seem harsh, but are we certain #lance #Armstrong did have cancer? Is his #Livestrong charity also built on lies? I really hope not.

Dear Twitter. I have neglected thee over the past few months. I promise to visit thee more often from this day forward.

RIP Uncle Walt.

Chief of UK Twitter currently on Radio 5. If he ever wanted to cut down to 138 characters he could stop saying 'so' in every sentence.

@sarah_cawood Have you borrowed one of Hunter's cups??  It looks more like a training cup with no lid on!!! (Agree about the Viscount)

@NottmForestNews I think we should improve the City Ground, and then maximise gate receipts with 'dynamic pricing', as some US teams do.

Someone on my street has put their Xmas decs up already! I must ask them if they celebrate Easter in January.

America, would I be correct in saying you have just spent around $4bn in election campaigning to get you to the same position as yesterday?

Lady at the shop told me my euro lotto ticket is a winner.  Does anyone know, if I don't win, am I able to sue her for false advertising?

@RockstarGames Just driving round, pretending I was in Magnum or Miami Vice #ViceCityMemories

@hollywills I thought you might have 'turned'.

@ajhmurray @keelingover @guernseypress Al, I didn't know you moonlighted as Satan?!

@RockstarGames I am so f***in' excited. #bigkid

Off to play golf, Jean Michel Jarre playing loudly as I drive in a Range Rover. My 20 year self would be outraged, but I'm loving it #older

Why, when I look out of my office window at 4:25pm, does it look like 9pm?  #winteriscoming

@TheDisneyBlog I'd guess it's some toilets!!

It's Saturday, before 7am, cold, dark &amp; wet. Time for a run!!

Tired head. Comes with letting your dog spend the night with you. At least wife now agrees I am right - dogs should sleep in cages.

So glad I have Wednesday as my day off!  C'mon #England

@julieetchitv I think that #newsatten might not be at ten tonight!  Have you got your sleeping bag?!?

Listening to these 4 on ITV before the England game taking the rip put of the situation is hilarious.

It's here!  Nottingham Survival of the Fittest. Let's get it on!!

Hate the current saying of 'bang on trend'. It's not cool. In fact, it is 'bang off trend'.

@ThemeParkNews All the very best wishes from a fellow Disney fan from Nottingham. I wish you, and your imminent family addition, well.

‚Äú@wdwfacts: http://t.co/OtRBRS94   Walt Disney World "Way Back Machine"‚Äù. Is there anyone who doesn't miss Horizons? #Epcot30

@TheDisneyBlog ...I will be back over at some point for WDW marathon, and I want to visit every Disney park and still have to go to DL &amp; DCA

@TheDisneyBlog I'd not seen them til just now (haven't been shown in the UK). They do ring true-both as a child and an adult

@43SquareMiles @lurkyloo I'd argue that if you had some popcorn with it you could call it cereal.

@NickCoulson @ajhmurray Perhaps he was sick of his own overinflated ego - I know I am.

@ajhmurray Is it nissing it down?

@sportchippers Is that the European team I see on top of Mount Everest?  How did they get ip there in those flip flops?

@SarahMillican75 Some women do take their pussy's to gigs (and get them out), but I think that is an entirely different type of show.

@NottmForestNews If they got the sums right, a full stadium means more merchandise sales which leads to filling the coffers. Supply &amp; demand

@43SquareMiles @progresscityusa Main Street popcorn vendor b/fast, Casey's lunch, Plaza Ice Cream Parlour tea (more time for attractions)!!

@loumongello In just over 2 wks I'm taking part in 'Survival of the Fittest' in Nottingham (UK), so am training today (never felt fitter!)

Woolwich - you really need to employ staff from the UK. I can't get a mortgage approved cause you don't understand 'factory fortnight'.

Based on recent performances, I thought John Terry retired from international football years ago.

@43SquareMiles @wdwfigment  I'll book a couple of hours out my diary in preparation!

@wdwfacts More of the actual theme for the ride, but Soarin'. I do like 'How do you do?' from Splash Mountain too.

@WorldOfWaltCom Yes - I think a stroll around World Showcase on a summer night, after IllumiNations crowds have gone, is very romantic

@AdleneGUEDIOURA No worries. A couple of goals against the sheep and all is forgotten.

From this moment forward I'm taking control. If it ain't good enough you sort it or I sort it. If it is good enough, we're all happy.

@ThemePark Want to swap countries?  It's 7am here in England and 50, rising to a max 67 today (and that will be the warmest all week).

@wdwfacts I'm teetotal so disagree anyway. Walt wanted a place unlike other parks - I think Fantasyland should remain alcohol free.

.... Bon Jovi singing 'Never Say Goodbye' (late 80s song) and yesterday I saw someone for the 1st time in over 20 years (loved her like mad)

Should I read anything into this - sat waiting to go into a conference overlooking an airport (dream job is a pilot), listening to.....

@ThemePark That attraction has some really in-depth scenery. One of the best boat rides I've seen.

‚Äú@MarioBaloteLAD: #GTAMemories RT if you remember this place... http://t.co/wTPsA90C‚Äù  I remember arriving for the 1st time on my BMX!

Would love to sit out all night under the clear sky, chiminea blazing, watching planes fly over. Work tomorrow dictates I should turn in :(

In the garden with the chiminea blazing away. Just had to move my chair back - it's roaring!! http://t.co/VgA9BGQW

RT @_TheAdamSandler: DON'T STOP RETWEETING THIS! http://t.co/vqWHjXVQ

@AngryDisneyNerd I agree. During EMH, past 2am, on a warm summer night with not many guests so you can take in the whole environment.

@TheDisneyBlog Sidewalks are close to roads. I guess they are called sidewalks cause you use them to walk along the side of the road.

@TheDisneyBlog As tragic as this, If anyone leaves a sidewalk and falls/rides into a vehicle, it is an accident, nothing more.

@TheDisneyBlog I feel the WDW transport system is extremely safe. For the amount of traffic &amp; people the accident numbers are very low.

@JohnBishop100 @mo_farah I see you've nicked Mo's gold medal - not really helping the reputation of scousers there!

@Disney Incredibles(if Pixar are included).I feel frustrated like Bob, but inside still feel young and dynamic,but my body says the opposite

Those poor overworked darlings back at school today. How will they cope after 6 weeks off?  Oh, I mean the teachers, not the kids!

@mistrollingin I was there - when times were great. Hope #NFFC will be able to get back there with SOD.

‚Äú@infromthetrent: Jermaine Jenas to Sunderland deal is OFF. #Spurs #SAFC‚Äù. Is he coming back to #NFFC ?

Daughter asked me what came before www. on the Internet. She didn't believe me when I said books!

@wdwfacts The first attraction at WDW I remember riding, almost 33 years ago to the day (20/8/79) #memories

@TheDisneyBlog Not really a scene, but I love the montage of the movie clips at the end.

@sarah_cawood It also stops snacking. I can't be bothered to key a snack onto the app, so I don't bother eating it!!  Give it a try.

@sarah_cawood I use an app called 'MyFitnessPal'. Use it to keep track of all calories in and cals used, and the net loss helps lose weight.

@UniversalORL go to the Panda Express for some of the best theme park food I have ever tasted.

Great start - IT problems!

@43SquareMiles They used to do those at the Plaza Ice Cream Parlour on Main Street - I love them (if a little messy!)

@43SquareMiles We've mentioned the Christmas Tree' before. I guess an avatar based on that is out the question?

@43SquareMiles I reckon you've just had the best Saturday ever!! #jealous

Dreamt we lost 1-0 today. I hope this isn't a bad omen for #NFFC

@TheDisneyBlog Not sure if they still do it, but the Plaza Ice Cream Parlour did a ice cream sandwiched between 2 choc chip cookies.

Just over half an hour this morning to attempt to get onto my computer - I only want to open 3 programs, and so far have none open.

@infromthetrent I'd have Camp, so long as he acts in the manner of the 2 playoff seasons, and not his unconcerned attitude of last season.

Why is it that when IT people 'fix' your computer it always ends up with more problems than before?

@43SquareMiles All I need now is a photo of the last room on the corridor, 2nd floor, block opposite Baloo (Playdoh), facing Hourglass Lake!

@wdwfacts It's at the Old Key West Resort.

Why are IT people paid so much money when they can't even get my computer to boot up. I'm on the verge of smashing it to bits. Boot that up

Those lightbulbs on the people in blue suits - where did they get them from? I thought that type of bulb was banned!!! #closingceremony

@sarah_cawood Is the emotion getting to you already??

Seagulls are already sounding vociferous tonight. I think councils should approve seagull culling.

If anyone in the twitterverse is feeling warm tonight it's probably from the glow off my overexposed-to-the-sun forehead.

Sometimes wish my life had taken a different path. At the moment I wish I was on a path with @phebes06

Unbelievable. I go to the loo, and wife just goes off to bed!  Doesn't even say that she's going! I guess I'll move the dog cages then!

The best part about this holiday is the time to go for a long run every day. Reckon I should be up for a 9 miler tomorrow.

Why am I only happy on holiday when I'm by myself?  Perhaps it's because wife, daughter &amp; 2 dogs requirements come first?

I thought I was on holiday, but clearly I am just the driver and bank for our dogs holiday.

Another sunny morning and starting work at silly o'clock. Told my wife I'd be home at lunch - I think I should have stayed at work all night

@ThemePark Probably the Rope Drop Sprint. Although if you had 'Marathon', to be at a park from opening to closing without stopping, I'd win.

It's always the same - last day tomorrow before I go on holiday and all the shit in the world keeps hitting industrial sized turbines.

Whilst it's sunny outside I'm inside trying to catch up with work, all so I can go on holiday next week when it will be raining #illogical

@wdwfacts Journey into Imagination (I think!)

@TomDaley1994 Ignore the haters. They will never get close to achieving what you have - and there will be more opportunities.

@ThemeParkNews Definitely.Obviously not as nice as when it's sunny, and water rides aren't as fun, but I'll visit theme parks in any weather

@ajhmurray It is a laser beam to kill all the terrorists that the missiles don't get.

@Official_NFFC I thought Tyson was back, before the picture loaded. Thought he was fed up of wearing his sheep's fleece!  #NFFC

@TaylorHerringPR I'd guess LOCOG will have that down within the hour!

@wdwfacts Epcot. I love the diversity of the different Future World attractions coupled with walking around World Showcase at night.

Just bought the winning Euro lottery ticket. However, I was confused the the cashier told the person after me they also had the winner.

@NottmForestNews I hope we're not going to become a toy for the owners, do they can bring Middle East players over just to play in England.

@DisneyParks I love Epcot at night. A walk round World Showcase, followed by Mission Space, Soarin, Test Track &amp; Spaceship Earth.

@DisneyParks It's on my 'Bucket List' to visit every Disney park. Done the 4 in Florida, plus DLP.

@loumongello @waltdisneyworld .. the Polynesian. The one word reason is the VIEW from the beach. (OK - 1 word in a short sentence!)

@NottmForestNews I suppose at least Sven is a bit more iconic than O'Driscoll.

@NottmForestNews Iconic?

@theJeremyVine @ajhmurray I'd go down to the ATM and get your ¬£130 for your fine out now.

I hope Amir Khan doesn't quit. I want him to take a few more beatings first.

@SarahMillican75 Wife &amp; daughter thought Katy Perry's 'I Kissed a Girl' had the line 'taste of cherry chopsticks'. #misheardlyrics

I wonder if all these players leaving #NFFC are having second thoughts after the takeover?

@wdwfacts Is that on the actual site of POTC, or elsewhere?  There doesn't look like much themeing around.

@NottmForestNews Clark has always been there when we needed him, particularly after Brian died. I hope new owners don't piss on him now.

@NottmForestNews I'm on holiday in Bournemouth in a few weeks. Shall I give Harry a lift back? #NFFC

@UORnews my first visit to IoA, on a hot summers day, and riding Hulk &amp; Spiderman, then cooling off at Jurassic River Adventure.

I think I'd better start saving for trips to Euro Champions League finals #NFFC

Glad to see the hosepipe ban's been lifted. Although it isn't raining yet today so I'm worried the ban might be back tomorrow.

@wdwfacts I'd guess the WDW Swan.

@prodnose I thought the idea of the water slide from the top back down to the bottom would have been met with greater approval.

Not good enough NatWest. If I get a DIP on Tues &amp; part key an app yesterday, I don't now expect to be told  to rekey due to computer error.

@ThemeParkNews It's the Caribe every time for me, mainly for the pool.

@footballfocusuk Chairman seems to be denying all responsibility.It's your bill, pay it. Just the same as anyone else has to pay their bills

@talkNFFC Please....no!  I can't stand the bloke.

@ThemeParkNews IMO this is comparable to any US park (inc WDW). Been many times and usually stay on-site.I think Stampida is rougher than FB

@wdwfacts I'm always confused about this. How fast is the drop at Tower of Terror?

Happy Independence Day to all those I follow in the US @loumongello @43SquareMiles @DisneyD23 @UORnews @JimHillMedia @2Manhattans

Happy Independence Day to all those I follow in the US @DisneyParks @Disney @DisneyPixar @wdwfacts @WaltDisneyWorld @attractions @SeaWorld

So today someone is trying to find 'God's Particle'. I guess if they find that they never have a problem finding their car keys.

@wdwfacts I think it is Tower of Terror. Surely the drop is faster than any coaster?

@TheDisneyBlog When I last visited in 2010 I would say it was the Studios.

I wonder what sort of pension/pay-out Bob Diamond is on? #brokenbritain

@wdwfacts I'm going with Contemporary, Polynesian and Wilderness Campground.

What are the odds on an Italian red card before the night is over?

Watching original Italian Job on Film 4. Great Sunday movie.

@footballfocusuk Ridiculous. Think about the fans having to travel all over Europe.  Is that good economic sense?

@43SquareMiles I'm guessing the translations are 'forward' and 'backward'!?!

@NottmForestNews I guessed we were down that end before I even looked. Surely that will change post-takeover

@ajhmurray Ah fuck it. Can't be doing with all this hanging around. I'll go first.

On the whole yesterday was not good. I hope today is somewhat better. Although the sun giving way to rain is not the most positive of starts

Welcome back. I missed you. #euro2012

@loumongello Forget the rain, get to the parks and enjoy the shorter lines. It's only water!

@talkNFFC I thought Hart would take one. He is supposed to be a good striker of the ball. Perhaps he was going 5th.

2 points - a) how many men have Italy got on the pitch?  b) stop trying to play Mario offside.

Amazing - the Italian walks again.

@prodnose I think they need to get you on TV as a pundit #tellitlikeitis

@ThemePark I love the open spaces at WDW, and don't mind driving between parks. In England so much is crammed together.

@loumongello @disneypixar Not a feature movie, but Boundin' is my favourite. It shows even the smallest guy can bounce back from a setback.

@footballfocusuk Yes. I tweeted about 1 minute before he scored that I would take him off - thought he was useless except for his goal.

@ajhmurray I'm going for Tony Blair #celebritytaxdodger

I'd probably be upset about the days now getting shorter if it wasn't for the weather making no difference if it is night or day #summer?

@loumongello I like to rent a SeaRaycer, visit all the hotels, and have a sundae at Downtown. Only point of yours I don't rate is D.Quest.

@talkNFFC Don't know who pissed you off mate, but I'm sure there are more people out there who appreciate your tweets compared to the haters

After fully charging my motorbike battery this afternoon I go to start it for a balmy evening ride and..... won't start #gutted

@prodnose I thought my TV was broken - no football.

@SarahMillican75 Why did your Indian restaurant break #chiefbrody 's favourite toy?

Off work tomorrow, want to get out on my motorbike but battery is flat. Hope I can get it charged for a decent run out.

@SarahMillican75 What if they all said 'I give you ¬£100'??

@43SquareMiles ...... or not working quite as hard, and reading your tweets to remind me of why I should be working hard!!

@wdwfacts Splash Mountain. I know the movie has some political issues, but it's one of my favourite Disney movies of all time #uncleremus

Right. Now we've had a 20 minute apocalypse let's go on and win. Need to shut Ibrohimovic and his pink boots up.

@ajhmurray It's for the athletes-once they have raced/lifted/thrown etc they remove their doped up blood and replace it with our clean blood

@bisping @markvoss21 Count, if he thinks no-one cares then I'm sure he wouldn't be bothered if you caved his face in.

@TheDisneyBlog I think Treasure Planet has some of the best animation and artistry of any Disney movie.

@43SquareMiles @progresscityusa @27000acres @2manhattans I want that magic carpet to whisk me off to WDW. I'll even learn German!

Dentist this morning. It will hurt :(

@attractions @disneypixar Hopefully everyone will sit down and watch the movie. It looks like commotion on that flight.

I have a good feeling about today, which hasn't yet been dampened - not even by the random prostitute who has decided to follow me.

@43SquareMiles I only saw the words Cake, Cookie, Chocolate Frosting!

@JimHillMedia One of the best WDW books I have. I always buy a couple of books on every visit (subject to flight weight allowance)

@phebes06 If my dream last night was real, thanks for the voicemail &amp; don't worry about it, cause I feel the same way too.

@wdwfacts Peter Pan - a lot easier than the 'Where am I?' question.

@janicemcivor You'll love it. I'd move there tomorrow. Try everything and don't put anything off til the next day. Enjoy!

Is it just me, or does the Archbishop of Canterbury always look a couple of prayers short of a full sermon? #madvicarlook

@wdwfacts Can only assume somewhere in the Italy pavilion at Epcot.

Is Andy Murray intentionally trying to spoil the #jubilee holiday? Or is he just trying to get back to watch the concert?

@43SquareMiles I thought it was an 'all work, no play' trip?  Now get back on those Star Jets!

@hollywills I remember hearing that there is some bedroom action everytime you get new shoes. Those shoes look a bit spiky - take care!!!

@wdwfacts The Sci-Fi Dine In at the Studios

@ThemePark Is there anywhere to see blueprints of the attractions, parks etc?

@attractions They don't see the magic in theme parks.I was the one out at 2am on WDW magic hours and up at 6am, as stayed by the hotel pool.

@attractions They've been before ('04 &amp; '10), but it was the last flight home that has put them off. I want to go to DL &amp; TDS (done DLP).

@attractions Family won't cruise either, or train (so DLP is out).  2 options: I come over by myself or we wait for the Atlantic to dry up!!

@attractions As in, I live in the UK so I'm planning a 6-8 week road trip all around the US, to include WDW, DL, all Universals, Vegas etc

@attractions This made me realise that from all my visits to WDW I have never seen any firework display from anywhere other than Main Street

@wdwfacts Is it the queuing area for Indiana Jones at the Studios?

@attractions Sad we'll never see this view again. In 40 years time your photo will be pulled out of an archive and people will reminisce.

@DisneyD23 Not sure. I'm guessing at 1990. SpectroMagic is my most favourite Disney parade ever.

@samhowzit @waltdisneyworld Times have to move on but I remember riding when I was 7, way back in '79. Sad that an iconic original is going.

@wdwfacts The Ice Station at Epcot.

MBNA - why would I give you my bank details so you can send me a refund when I don't have a card with you? I am not that stupid. #hoax

@DisneyParks Is the 17 minute promotional film available to see anywhere now?

@43SquareMiles I guess you have been on at least one attraction 'just one more time' more than you needed to. I know I would!!

@43SquareMiles I've not been to TDL yet, but somehow I can't believe it is possible to have 'no play'?!

@43SquareMiles Is this a work trip or vacation?

@wdwfacts I'm guessing, but I'd say somewhere on the Backlot Tour at the Studios.

@43SquareMiles @chrisevans I'm 40 - our last visit I was the one out at the parks each night whilst wife &amp; daughter were in bed. Go for it!

@43SquareMiles Maybe, but I can't get the taste of a citrus swirl, the spray from Splash Mountain or smell the aroma of the hot Florida sun.

@zzgator @43squaremiles @hunnypups I have this vague memory of watching from a launch way back in '79. Either that or from a ferry to TTC.

@43SquareMiles @zzgator I love this although it seems to be kept as one of those secrets you just stumble across. See it every visit.

@43SquareMiles Just arriving at Epcot to re-live an Extra Magic Hours evening from summer 2010.  iPad fully charged! http://t.co/EmvtB5I8

@43SquareMiles Almost home! http://t.co/HmINoONI

@43SquareMiles It was fun. It's now just gone 11pm and not quite as warm. Just riding the monorail from MK to TTC (no queues in my garden!)

@43SquareMiles Would love to. However, on the 1st hot evening in England this year I'm sat by my pond watching Disneyland opening ceremony.

Feeling emotional. Wish I was in Florida right now.

Gorgeous weather. Day off but have to go to work for a few hours so I think I'll cruise in on my motorbike #ThatsHowWeRoll

@wdwfacts IMO, this was a mistake. People come from all over the world to see Cinderella's Castle and not an inflatable cake.

@wdwfacts I want to say the Contemporary Resort foyer *fingers crossed*

@wdwfacts It's at Animal Kingdom, where Expedition Everest runs through.

Littlewoods. I don't shop with you so stop sending me emails offering vouchers. Like I'm going to give out my personal details to get them.

@wdwfacts I love Soarin, have to visit Spaceship Earth, ToT is great, as is PhilharMagic, but all time favourite is Splash Mountain.

Watched Treasure Planet today. Has to have some of the best animation ever. I guess it would look awesome on an IMAX screen.

@sarah_cawood I think you answered your own question!

That program 'It's Me or the Dog'. Is there one called 'It's Me or the Dogs, Cats, Hamsters, Turtles and Fish'?? #livinginazoo

@wdwfacts They surround Tom Sawyer Island at Magic Kingdom.  It's what the Riverboat sails on.

@43SquareMiles Just ridden it!! Off to ride Body Wars now (ie sit at my desk at throw myself around in my chair). I'm ready for funny looks!

@43SquareMiles It is!  (Being 5 hours ahead of you and reading your tweet 5 hours after you posted it!)

@43SquareMiles Pah!  Big deal!  I'm in my kitchen (in England) and just decided to go on Soarin'.  (Thanks YouTube).

@ThemePark I admit, the day after arriving does us big favours with reverse jet lag - was up at 3am a couple of years ago, ready to go!

'This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be' - Nickleback's Rock Star. Sum's up my feelings exactly this morning :(

@Glasgow_Red There must be an error - I can't see London!!! #NFFC

@DisneySports The WDW Marathon is on my 'Bucket List'. Flying from England so I'm off to check the bank account to see if this is the year!

@DLthings @themepark @attractions I disagree. Living in England and not being able to easily get to the parks like to know others thoughts.

Sat in the car at supermarket, sun coming through sunroof, looking at fast-food drive thru opposite. Wish I was in Florida right now.

@wdwfacts I only watched a round trip of TTA/WPP on YouTube this morning!

@phebes06 I know who he is now. #prayforlewismighty #prayforlewismighty #prayforlewismighty #prayforlewismighty #prayforlewismighty

@phebes06 The morning is now over and you haven't spoken to me. Could it be because I am not Lewis Mighty?  (Oh, and xx back to you too)

@ThemePark Usually some kind of ice-cream. If not, a large coke to cool me down and keep the energy levels up.

@ThemeParkNews I've ridden Dragon Khan loads, and the view from the top is great. Can't wait to see the view from the top of this!!!!

I was wrong. #mcfc

A few weeks ago I tweeted that the Arsenal win at L'pool in the final seconds to win the league would never be beaten in terms of excitement

Stuck on the phone to someone I know I'm not going to get any business from.

@43SquareMiles @huskycaucasian I agree. Best times at WDW have been summer nights at Epcot, on Extra Magic Hours at almost closing #memories

@ThemePark I've done nearly everything in the Orlando parka, but never went on the Skyway at Magic Kingdom.  #themeparkchat

@goes_to_eleven @ajhmurray I heard that his fingers didn't bleed, but were slightly sore. He was trying it on for a compensation claim.

Accord Mortgages - does it really take 19 minutes (and counting) to check if you have looked at an email I sent on Tuesday? #useless

@43SquareMiles It looks like it's trying to get away from the STT!!!

@attractions @24hoursindisney Might be a value resort, but I love that place.

@ajhmurray I thought that the Co-op was the big society?

@SarahMillican75 I hope that wasn't the same finger as when you couldn't be bothered to reach for the loo roll.

@ThemeParkNews No - Hulk at IOA is not that tall but is a great coaster.

Good luck to #ncfc from an #nffc fan. Also, I hope #swfc go up. Still bitter about #sufc from Warnock days.

@SkySportsNews ....booking when he brought down Charles, and bust his leg. After 21 years I'm still bitter!!

I think it's wrong that the Cup Final is not the last game of the season, with a 3pm kick off. #justsayin

@43SquareMiles @imagineeringdis I did see it-after coming over from England I was disappointed to see the magic covered by an inflated cake.

@KeirSimmonsITV @ajhmurray These ground to air missiles.Has anyone thought what to do if terrorists walk into London cause they can't fly?

@NottmForestNews Missed the European Cup Final (too young), but I did make it over for our Uefa Cup came in 1995. It was bloody freezing!!!

On hold to Accord Mortgages - music playing is 'Keep Bleeding'. Ironic seeing as that is how I feel trying to do business with them.

It amazes me how you can't go through a day without seeing a Disney product or ad. One man started this. As a Disney fan this makes me happy

@43SquareMiles I guess you could count it as research? I'm a mortgage consultant in England - and you can't get mortgages in Disney Dollars!

@43SquareMiles Also, all these tweets with clips of yesteryear make me thankful I have my own office *sits watching clips uninterrupted*

@43SquareMiles Thankfully jet-pack man landed before the balloons were sent up - potential disaster averted.(Can I have one to get to work?)

@VictorChandler @nottmforestnews @sportchippers .....Southampton was a few years later. I wonder what's become of them?!?!

@VictorChandler @nottmforestnews @sportchippers  It was the Simod Cup then, but became the Zenith Data Systems Cup when we beat Southampton-

@NottmForestNews @sportchippers On this day, 23 years ago, Garry Parker scored the best goal I have ever seen at Wembley #NFFC v Everton

Today has been a thoroughly miserable day - and I don't just mean the weather :(

@wdwfacts I'm in rainy England. After checking the weather over there I think I'd go for the Studios (with a trip to Epcot in the evening).

@jefflipack @43squaremiles @minniemgirl Was going to say 'forget the bed, I want the map', but saw tweet about the price. House remortgage?

How come Will I Am wasn't stopped at customs withe the amount of dope he brought in? #thevoiceuk

@prodnose I shall expect they will arrive in Dover in the next few hours seeking asylum.

I'm quite happy with Steve Cotterill. However, can't wait for Pep Guardiola to start on Monday #NFFC

@ThemePark In Orlando, I say remove T2 and bring back Kongfrontation.

@wdwfacts The most relaxing WDW room (as opposed to resort) I've had was at Pop Century 1960s block, 2nd floor overlooking hourglass lake.

@mainstgazette Easy one for me - turkey leg. And why? I don't like churros!

@SarahMillican75 If you stand still, and are really quiet, I think you can hear them crying. What type of person would be so cruel??

@jimsmallman @barryskellern @ajhmurray I'll be happy for all the traffic to be in London - I'll be able to get home quicker #everycloud

@ThemePark I know you can get it on apps, Internet etc, but current wait times through the TV would be good.

@hollywills I bet you don't sit down with the whole family and watch @CelebJuice

@wdwfacts I've been visiting since 1979 - there are too many memories to have a favourite!

@attractions It was something very similar. Small balls of frozen ice cream - I remember I didn't like them too much!

@attractions They had them when I was there in 1997!!!

@ThemePark Tokyo Disney. Although if I won the lottery I would be visiting all of them, just Tokyo Disney is the one I would visit first.

@CelebJuice @lemontwittor @carolineflack1 I'm sure Keith could explain why experience is better than youth!

@43SquareMiles @ericarose @exprcoofto I change mine every-time someone like your good-selves tweets a photo I like (where do I send the $$?)

@wdwfacts We've had this before - think Star Tours. If I'm wrong again I should learn from my mistakes!

Second classic work comment of the day. Colleague had a car accident - "it was her fault, but I drove into her".

Classic comment at work - colleague going to her 2nd wedding of the year. The first - New Years Eve!  I think you'll find that was last year

@wdwfigment Not the most inspirational, but sit me in the Earful Tower with a Citrus Swirl machine and I'm sure I'll be ok. #studioszombies

@ThemeParkNews That looks like the smoothest ride I've ever seen on a coaster.

@trududoll @ajhmurray If you had called your computer 'Titanic' you could have felt such a hero when you restarted it.

I'm guessing Ashley Young won't be on the next series of Dancing on Ice - he can't even stand up on grass. #cheat #diving

@wdwfacts It's the waterway that joins the Swan, Dolphin and Boardwalk hotels to the Disney Studios.

@43squaremiles Ignore last tweet - thought it was where to hide zombies, not to hide from them! #mkzombies

@wdwfacts Today, I'd go for Cosmic Ray's.

I should have guessed - I take the piss out of Carroll and he scores the winner.

Is it fair to play 'advantage' when Andy Carroll has the ball?  Surely there is no advantage other than to the opposition.

Is Suarez the dumbest footballer around?  Rugby tackling Heitinga. Perhaps his teeth were weighing him down.

@zannaland @43squaremiles @luvlifeinfl Thanks. When I'm missing WDW (usually hourly) I tend to go on YouTube for a bit of area loop music!

@43SquareMiles @zannaland @luvlifeinfl   What is the WDW book/poster in the background on the right-hand-side picture?  I want one!

@wdwfacts In the queue area for Expedition Everest.

Why do people bring kids to financial meetings? I know childcare can be an issue, but we're talking almost ¬£150K, not 37p and a curly wurly!

@GLSlater The Gemma I used to work with would usually have some batteries to ensure she would never be bored.

@wdwfacts Richard F Irvine?

Student's warning after being duped in laptop scam http://t.co/XhvxAsTG. If this guy qualifies who would employ him as their accountant now?

Just had a call asking me to claim my refund, and I will lose it if I don't claim soon. Refund for what? And why are you calling me at work?

@wdwfacts In 1971, on October 1st. I was born on 30th September 1971, hence the name 'One Day Older'. #nowyouknow

Wife has confiscated wallet. She's worries I might send Samantha 'hit with a' Brick some flowers.

@Harry_Flowers @ajhmurray I agree. Star Wars should not need to sell out to anyone at any cost.

@wdwfacts Only guess I can make is Typhoon Lagoon.

‚Äú@DisneyPixar: In this world of ups and downs, so nice to know there are Jackalopes around. http://t.co/hAcEwquc‚Äù. My favourite Pixar short.

@wdwfacts It was the WEDway People Mover.

@screamscape @westcoasternet  I have this firm belief that anything Walt personally oversaw should remain as he wanted.

@wdwfacts Is that the back end of the Magic Kingdom, and the main cast member entrance into the utilidors?

That awkward 'if you don't know what's wrong I'm not telling you' scenario at our house this morning. #nowinsituation

@ThemePark I love Haunted Mansion, but the whole experience of Harry Potter means the IOA ride gets it for me.

@wdwfacts I'll say Maharaja Jungle Trek, which is usually what I do every time there is something Asian themed.

#NFFC Brilliant. 2-0 up against Southampton in 4 minutes. Bart-Williams (1) & Reid (4). Then I woke up #gutted

@screamscape Tokyo Disneyland. You have 17 ride rehabs which seems a lot compared to other parks. I wondered if I was missing something?

@wdwfacts I'm going to guess at Jungle Cruise.

I'm guessing that the Milan players have never heard of Muamba, the way they are falling all over is disgraceful. I hope Barcelona win.

...... out cruising on my motorbike, burgerking/McDs for lunch, and fajitas for tea. If I drank I'd have a Bud, but as I don't it'll be coke

Ok. I've designated my day as an America day. Watched YouTube movies of my favourite theme park rides, breakfast is poptarts, then .......

.......of interest. I reckon it will be at least a 6 week trip. Plan to do it all by motorbike #livingthedream

The way the day is warming up feels like I'm in Florida. I'm in a happy mood. However, still feel I was born the wrong side of the Atlantic.

It's going to be a hot one today. Done the weekly shop, just got to Hoover and then I'm out on my bike all day.

@MensHealthUK There's nothing stated for the dose I receive - about once every 2-3 months.  Looks like I'll get every illness going.

Driving in sunny Nottingham listening to the Beach Boys. I realise 2 things - I was born in the wrong country, and was born in the wrong era

@wdwfacts It's a Small World. Thanks - the tune is now stuck in my head!

@UORnews I prefer Jurassic Park River Adventure.

@AskLloydsTSB It came through to my work email. I'll get it over to you either tomorrow or Monday.

@ThemePark Hulk for me. Nice queue for Manta, just never enjoyed the ride experience.  It's that loop where you feel pushed right back.

Lloyds TSB threatening to suspend my account unless I confirm my bank and security details by e-mail. Thanks, but I don't have a LTSB a/c.

From this point onwards I shall be known as One Day Older.  Also my photo has changed to the wonder of Spaceship Earth, taken at about 2am.

@wdwfacts One Man's Dream. It closed the day we arrived on our last visit, and re-opened the day after we left :(

@DisneyD23 I think it was the Polynesian.

@wdwfacts I think it is Coronado Springs.

@imagineeringdis @43SquareMiles Tough one - I've been on Space Mountain since 1979, but I'd guess either Splash Mountain or Spaceship Earth.

@imagineeringdis @43SquareMiles Probably the Plaza Ice Cream Parlour at the end of Main Street.

Not a good start to the day. Without being too graphic, all of the food I ate over the weekend is no longer in me.

@sarah_cawood It'll be your turn next year!

@lemontwittor Keith, I expect to see you aak @Fearnecotton if she has seen @hollywills #jackson5bush on this weeks #celebjuice

I don't usually praise corporate companies, but Sky's F1 qualifying on their F1HD channel was awesome.

I'm missing America today, particularly Florida. Not been for 18 months and I'm needing another visit. Problem - wife &amp; daughter hate flying

Bernard Matthews Mini Kievs for tea. Bag says average contents of 15 - I have 16. #bonus

@NottmForestNews I used to think she was fit. Now I know she's been fucked by a sheep I wouldn't go near her. #NFFC

Is David Luiz actually Sideshow Bob from The Simpsons?

Car in for service and MOT today. In other news, beans on toast for tea for the next month.

....reserved your service is usually shit. Unless you give me funds at 9am it will be a long time til I use you again.

Oh Woolwich. I am so going to fucking have you at 9am. Staying up til half midnight for your system not to work, and now at 5:56am you......

How can this be?  I will be up at 6am and, if all the funds have gone, I am going to be on the phone at 9 and you will suffer.

Woolwich - you wankers.I've stayed up til midnight to reserve mortgage funds for clients, &amp; my user details are being used by someone else?!

@ThemePark For me it depends on the time of day. Seeing as I have to pick one, I'd go for Splash Mountain.

Does David Cameron have to go through the same passport controls as the rest of us when we go to the US. I guess not.

@wdwfacts As much as I love Disney and #waltdisneyworld dearly, this was a massive faux pas.

@wdwfacts 5 - Mickey's PhilharMagic, Captain Eo, Muppet Vision, It's Tough to be a Bug, and Toy Story Mania.

@wdwfacts I reckon it's the Tortuga Tavern near POTC.

Knackered. At work since 8am after spending 4 hours awake through the night cause wife couldn't sleep - and I got no 'benefit' at all.

@wdwfacts At 'It's Tough To Be A Bug'

@wdwfacts I think there are 4 - if you count the one between France and United Kingdom.

@wdwfacts Discovery Island. Sad I never got to visit :(

@WaltDisneyWorld I'd have to go for the Studios today.

RIP Robert Sherman. So many people will have been uplifted by your music without knowing much about you. Go and dream with Walt again.

@wdwfacts It's the crazy golf course next to Blizzard Beach.

@wdwfacts It's the Coral Reef.

@wdwfacts It's Tough to be a Bug, in the Tree of Life, at Animal Kingdom.

@prodnose Same reason I don't leave my wife - one day she might want to have sex again.

Really fucked - spent 45 mins on a GTAIV mission rescuing Roman from a warehouse and as I was leaving pressed X just as PS3 wanted an update

@wdwfacts Really tough one. If I could only visit one I'd say Haunted Mansion.

@andrewstanton How many Disney parks have you visited around the world? (I mean the globe - not just #waltdisneyworld)

@wdwfacts I remember this from my first visit in 1979. Such a shame I couldn't take my daughter on it. She has only seen it on You Tube :(

@WaltDisneyWorld @disneyparks I always have a Dulce Dazzler from the Haagen Dazs place at Downtown Disney.

@wdwfacts I wish I was. I'm 3000 miles away in England, but there is nowhere I would rather be than #waltdisneyworld for #Disney24

I hope everyone @Disneyland and @WaltDisneyWorld enjoys their #Disney24   I wish I was there!

@wdwfacts I understand the reasons, but this was a big mistake.

@wdwfacts I think it was on the waterways of Animal Kingdom, near the Tree of Life.

@wdwfacts I reckon it's One Man's Dream at Disney Studios.

@wdwfacts Not a clue. I'd guess a restaurant as it looks like there are some tray stands. That's my answer - a restaurant.

Another weekend through without being able to do anything I wanted to do due to all the menial tasks required of me by the rest of family.

@DisneyParks On Extra Magic Hours night I love to walk round World Showcase Lagoon, followed by Soarin', Mission Space and Spaceship Earth.

@wdwfacts I think it is the prop room on the Back Lot Studio Tour.

I'm doing weekly shop cause the wife is too tired and going to bed. I guess she has taken up marathon running with how tired she always is.

@MensHealthUK I'm lucky to have sex 5 times in 6 months. On this research, metaphorically I'm fucked.

@DisneyParks It would be Epcot this weekend.

@Balbvs @SarahMillican75 If this is real it is hilarious.

@CelebJuice I almost laughed myself to death watching #ShoutingOneOut with #malcolm

Wife been in bed since half eight - "too tired". I'll stay up and do the housework then cause I'm not tired at all #sarcasm

@sarah_cawood Now I know how to look 'giddy with excitement'!

@wdwfacts It's been Dame Judi Dench since the last upgrade. #greatride

@wdwfacts I think it's on the Maharaja Jungle Trek at Animal Kingdom.

Holiday Inn Express Milton Keynes. Your rooms are so cold. I have the heating on full and am now getting into bed with a t-shirt on.

@sportchippers You've got it. I started to feel rough last Wednesday, spend Sat pm and Sunday in bed, and just getting over it now.

In the movies why do businessmen always get hot one night stands when working away? It's not happening at Holiday Inn Express Milton Keynes.

@wdwfacts Tom Sawyer Island

@43SquareMiles I've got the MK & Epcot videos. They were the only ones I could get that would play in the UK. Almost 20 years ago now.

@wdwfacts I reckon it's 4.

‚Äú@wdwfacts: http://t.co/37V1w7CL   Walt Disney World Sign of the Day‚Äù. Best sign in the World - and I mean the globe, not just WDW.

@wdwfacts I'm torn between WDW Railroad and one of the Main Street Trolley Cars. The Railroad if I was pushed for one.

@WaltDisneyWorld Either monorail pilot on the Epcot loop, or bus driver. Anything to see as much of #waltdisneyworld everyday as I could.

@43SquareMiles I've been there in torrential rain storms - still beautiful.

@DisneyParks I actually prefer SpectroMagic. First saw Electrical Parade in 1979 and I think it looks dated now.

‚Äú@wdwfacts  In what WDW theme park is there more than one entrance?‚Äù. Epcot - Main Entrance and International Gateway

‚Äú@wdwfacts: http://t.co/SBdyBIAT   Where in Walt Disney World am I?‚Äù Haunted Mansion.

@talkNFFC: Forest v Bristol City in April will be show on Sky Sports. #nffc. I'm sure that's just the game people sign up to Sky Sports for.

Exit List on ITV. Great TV - 2 thick scouse blokes taking 30 mins (so far) to get questions wrong and win fuck all. #nextstopmastermind

@wdwfacts I'm thinking Jungle Cruise, but would it be that easy?

@talkNFFC He shouldn't go. He never seems to last 90 minutes but I'd have him on every game - either the 1st half or the last 30.

@wdwfacts I was completely wrong - not even in the right park!

@sportchippers If everyone keeps going into administration we might get promoted #NFFC

@wdwfacts I would guess it's the Tower of Terror. I reckon the drop is faster than the acceleration at Rock'n'Roller coaster or Test Track.

@wdwfacts I have no idea. As a guess I'd say somewhere in the Imagination pavilion #waltdisneyworld #completeguess

@talkNFFC Would he claim a medal if they win the Premier League?  I bet that is what he is thinking about.

@phebes06 "If you're leaving will you take me with you...". Oasis. #let'sgo

@NottmForestNews I was there - sat in their new stand. The 4-0 win stood on the terracing some time before was better! #NFFC

@43SquareMiles @wdwfigment Nice. I was at Pop Century last year. Even though it is a Value Resort, we had a great view over Hourglass Lake.

@43SquareMiles I'd happily swap lunch for a crazy day at #waltdisneyworld anytime.

@liz_buckley @SarahMillican75   I've tried that before, but it isn't as easy with women.

@CelebJuice @schofe @clbleakley @fountain1987 @itv2   With @clbleakley being on I expect copious amounts of potato.

‚Äú@screamscape: Update: PortAventura - Shambhama Topped Off http://t.co/0FAL9FUP‚Äù. I've ridden Dragon Khan and this just dwarfs it #mustride

‚Äú@wdwfacts: http://t.co/Vq02Smt7  Walt Disney World "Way Back Machine"‚Äù. I regret never having visited River Country or Discovery Island :(

‚Äú@wdwfacts: http://t.co/MbHGnUKT   Where in Walt Disney World am I?‚Äù. Splash Mountain.

@wdwfacts In the queue for Buzz Lightyear Spaceranger Spin.

4 mile run in the snow. It felt more like 14 miles. Thought I was Rocky in Rocky IV.

Whatever you might say about him, Doughty has financed our club for years. RIP Nigel. #NFFC

@sarah_cawood I recommend you don't go - stay in and drink hot chocolate with marshmallows.

‚Äú@NottmForestNews: Rams shirts from Forest clash to be auctioned http://t.co/gyluDpVz‚Äù. I'll give you 50p for the lot. C'mon you Reds #NFFC

@kristinabroooke I have to disagree. Twice since July?!?!  Perhaps is who the marriage is to, and that's where I've gone wrong.

@attractions That would be all the incentive I'd need to win.

@DisneyParks Not quite a restaurant, but I do look forward to Beaches and Cream.

We used to be the biggest club in the Midlands. Soon I don't even think we'll be the biggest club in Nottingham #NFFC

@UKTesco Ilkeston. I always visit the same time each week, and there seems to be more managers looking around than cashiers available.

http://t.co/oIDVN9p9‚Äù. Proof that we are now a feeder club : ...(

@hollywills Is the football transfer window really entertaining you that much?

As things stand we are bottom and 5 points from safety. I hate to say it, but I think tonight is when we have to admit we're fucked #NFFC

@WaltDisneyWorld I was born the day after WDW opened, 1st visit in 1979. I feel I was born to work there - just an issue of  getting a Visa.

@sarah_cawood Re #whathavewestarted - all your life you will be wondering if the 2 shoves and a grunt were worth it. I'm sure they will be.

Martin O'Neill talking about Cloughie on ITV football. Brought a tear to my eyes #briancloughsredandwhitearmy #NFFC

Every time I see the 'visit California' advert I feel like grabbing my passport and getting on the next plane out of here #oneday

Reality hits. Didn't win the lotto. Dreams remain just that. Sorry to the other people in my dreams who don't get what I was offering.

7 mile run in the frost. Helped by dreaming about what I'll do if I won the lotto last night. Suppose I should now check if I won #reality

BBC Magician host. I'd prepare your CV. This is going to be your only stint on TV.

‚Äú@ajhmurray: KP one for 1. Uh oh.‚Äù. If ever there was someone not living up to their hype. Apart from Stuart Downing. And Gavin Henson.

@DisneyParks I'm in the mood for Epcot at the moment.

Is there anyone who wants to shake hands with John Terry?

@43SquareMiles @progresscityusa @sillywhims I have kept all my guides, tickets (even car lot passes) from '79, '93 & '97. #goodmemories

@DisneyParks If it's in the morning I'd do Test Track. In the evening I like to go on Spaceship Earth first.

Why do even experienced commentators say away goals count double?  If Cardiff beat Palace 2-1 it isn't a two-all draw #schoolboyerror

‚Äú@43SquareMiles: Carousel of Progress! Anyone else want to play? RT @ImagnryCupcakes: What is your favorite AA show in WDW?‚Äù Spaceship Earth

@SarahMillican75  I would advise walking around with your mouth open just in case the wind should blow them in that direction

@WaltDisneyWorld Saw a family of 5 struggle with it. I could probably eat the ice cream, but not all the toppings and sauce.

@Sk8ieSH I don't think he'd have wanted the kids to have missed out on some of the magic. Obama will be forgotten long before Disney.

‚Äú@Sk8ieSH: @attractions @easywdw This is a disgrace. Totally disgusted.‚ÄùI agree-if I was visiting I'd be very annoyed.What would Walt think?

‚Äú@StanCollymore: Gutted to see Forest struggle like this,gutted.‚Äù. C'mon Stan. If Thierry can do it I'm sure you'd be good for the last 20.

I hate to say this-I'm a bit nervous about #NFFC chances tonight. I hope we win cause a potential cup run could help get a few players in.

2 week fitness update (last week was embarrassing but I genuinely forgot to post) - weight same, fat -0.3%, water +0.2%, muscle +0.2% #ok

Why is it that if I don't sign my kid's school organiser she gets detention, but her form tutor has not signed it since Nov? #oneruleforone

Bad news is, and without being too graphic, after 195 days I was a bit too eager. #lackofselfcontrol

‚Äú@43SquareMiles: So rad.... It's been too long http://t.co/AI3yEwSK‚Äù. First saw this in 1979. Have to say though, I prefer SpectroMagic.

‚Äú@43SquareMiles: Bay Lake awaits http://t.co/W3nrCI0W‚Äù. Taking on of these out on Bay Lake was one of my favourite moments of my last trip.

@DisneyParks From the second I arrive at #waltdisneyworld until the second I leave - they are all magic moments.

‚Äú@UORnews: RT this if you LOVE visiting #UniversalOrlando at night! http://t.co/tD4ILuNa‚Äù. Theme parks are made for night visits.

In need of excitement. Work, pets, household chores and no sex is getting me down. Even training is a challenge at the moment.

I feel I need to take off & get away. Handing my notice in Monday, but it doesn't seem enough. Perhaps I'm missing summer #feelingnostalgic

Kid Rock's 'All Summer Long'. Don't know where he was singing about, but I wish I was back there in 1989 now #somethingsmissinginmylife

Conference Call - my life is ebbing away. Should be handing my notice in on Monday. I can't be doing with the corporate bollocks anymore.

@UORnews   For a split-second, the top of the Incredible Hulk launch.

Feeling a bit down today. Wish I was in the US. Need to plan my road trip. Always wanted to motorbike through the 48 mainland states #dreams

‚Äú@attractions: RT @OrlandoInformer: Universal Orlando Resort JAWS and Amity are no more. http://t.co/J869hk9v‚Äù. Sad:(

Bad news. In one week: weight up 1.5kg, fat up 1.3%, water down 0.9%, muscle down 0.6%. Serious work ahead #iblamechristmas

@SarahMillican75 Is your fella aware you are thanking people for keeping you company in lonely hotel rooms? #openrelationship

Is it ok to wish everyone a Happy New Year when 2012 is supposed to be the end of the world? #ohwell #happynewyear

Good to see ITV put on some great Saturday/New Year's Eve night TV, with the repeat of TV Burp from years ago #useless

May be 3.5 hrs early, but I'm off home. New job soon & I can't be arsed to stay. Plus phone battery is nearly out from playing games all AM.

Ok. I am now struggling to see how I will get through the remaining 2.5 hours without glasses of coke, sweets, Xmas TV #missingbeingonhols

The hot tomato soup I brought in a flask was not as exciting as I expected. Luke warm with slightly tough cobs is not Xmas party food.

@prodnose   I think that you have to have a sun-roof or convertible, then just stand up.

@SarahMillican75 Is your Tickle Me Elmo something you might find at Ann Summers?

Body assessment. I'll make my excuses first - been off all week and started the Xmas indulgence a few days ago. Result of which is......

‚Äú@43SquareMiles @wdwfacts: Walt Disney World "Way Back Machine"   http://t.co/9RfUS93t‚Äù. I regret never having the opportunity to visit RC.

@AnnaSianFeeney In which case, I won't wish you a Happy Birthday.

Amir Khan - you lost. Instead of throwing your toys out your pram why don't you face the truth, take stock then buckle down in your training

@prodnose I find wimmin are always on my mind. The weather being fine just crams more wimmin into my mind.

Rocky on ITV4 now. #brilliant. Rocky 2 on ITV4 next #2xbrilliant

Is a Flake just a naked Twirl?

‚Äú@prodnose: Down on the Pelvic Floor, people are asking How It Works? http://t.co/B7rk7S0T‚Äù. They actually tell you not to use when driving!

Gutted. In the office by myself, finishing off before breaking up, and there's no early kick-off to listen to on the radio #all3pmforonce

Last day today before using up my annual leave, which takes me to 30th Dec. It'll be a busy day finishing off, but worth it when I'm done :)

Had 3.5 hrs sleep in 40 hrs. Now stood downstairs ironing whilst wife is in bed cause she's tired!  I guess I'll be tidying the kitchen then

@SarahMillican75 I think putting clothes on before going on TV in front if millions is a good call. #wellthoughtoutplanspart1

Staff Xmas party last night. Food was terrible & 3 1/2 hrs sleep. Feel rough this morning. It wasn't a dodgy pint - I'm teetotal #dodgychef

‚Äú@43SquareMiles:@joeyinteractive: Shooting in the park this morning.  I have the castle lights all to myself! http://t.co/NaazrBe5‚Äù Magical!

Watching "Blood & Bones" on C5 - not quite the right type of inspiration I was looking for. #whatrules?

The training isn't the hard part. It's the part about the nutritionist I'm not keen on.  #Mcds #burgerking #Dominos #kfc

Meeting with trainer today who told me to buckle down if I want to fight again. Spent the next hour on a training plan for the whole of 2012

@talkNFFC I suppose back to back Champions League trophies, 2 league cups and a Premier League trophy would be a step too far #doneitbefore

Took off shoe when I got home from work to find one of those mini slugs had been keeping my toes company all day #nearlythrewup

Gutted. Weigh more, more body fat, and highest BMI for almost 2 years. Seriously need to get back on track. Lots of training over Xmas break

@hollywills I once heard that you had sex in every pair of new shoes you bought. With all those heels I think you've been having some fun!?

RT @justinmoorhouse: I'm in bits. Little kid in cafe loudly talking about skunks. How they spray etc, BUT saying spunk instead of skunk. ...

@sarah_cawood   I thought the Mac shop sold burgers, fries & coke?

‚Äú@NottmForestNews: Doughty pumps more cash into Forest http://t.co/1I69ni1C‚Äù. Whatever anyone might think about Doughty, he has saved #NFFC

My helpful hint of the day - If you don't want to find a leaflet from Relate, don't look through your wife's drawer.  #merrychristmas

Today is the birthdate of my hero, Walt Disney. If only my employer had an ounce of the business brain of Uncle Walt.

It's like kicking people out of a shop who are stood at the till ready to buy, to go and buy more stock #madness #notgotaclue

@AnnaSianFeeney Next?  I had a delivery in our blue bin last week.  Why don't they cut out the middleman and take it straight to the tip?

It has now been 150 days of sexual wilderness - surely there will be activity before 2012? Everyone has some luck at Christmas?!

Am I becoming bitter and twisted as I get older, or is the world not in a good state?

How can Iranians wreck our embassy, burn our flag and deface a photo of the Queen, yet if we show any level of patriotism we are racist?

@ajhmurray If the chip shop would know your usual, why do you need a satnav to get there?

Dilemma Day. Have 2 job offers & have to let someone down today. Wife wants to throw a sickie and stay in bed, & I have loads of appts in :(

‚Äú@NottmForestNews: McClaren: I quit Forest for good of club and fans http://t.co/VMBmGA07‚Äù. No. You quit cause you were shit.

‚Äú@attractions @SeaWorld - pick a type of bread and your choice of many toppings: http://t.co/Dk6HBVED‚Äù. Isn't that a Subway?

@SarahMillican75 I suggest checking his wallet for Ann Summers receipts.

@UORnews Had to look twice - the guy in the orange t-shirt looks like me, but I'm 3000 miles away!  I know where I'd rather be!

Just leaving work. What are the odds of my wife being in bed when I get home?  And I don't mean in a romantic way.

Knackered. Got to bed at quarter to midnight after doing loads of ironing, and am now up wondering if I can face the gym before work #tired

I hate the phrase 'win-win'. There's no such thing. It's called a draw.

@hollywills @sarah_cawood Judging by Sarah's recent tweet, I think Holly has stolen Sarah's sleeping time!!!

Am I really watching a TV program where D-Z list celebs are arguing and crying over a stuffed toy?  Suddenly soaps don't seem so bad.

Is a kangaroo an emu? I guess the presenter that is Jessica-Jane is never going to present mastermind! #imaceleb

@ProgressCityUSA @mfeige   I would pay good money for these, particularly the press pass for MK. Is the owner prepared to sell?

@43SquareMiles Certainly do wish I was there.

Jessica-Jane - I'm glad you had your breast implants. You look like you could float away without them weighing you down #imacelebrity

... I'm not the best person to ask - now gone 137 days without sex. Even after chat it was clear nothing was going to happen last night.

@DisneyParks The memories of being there when I was a kid.

@SarahMillican75  I agree - day off, taken daughter to school, been offered new job plus future partnership, and it's only half ten #goodday

I don't do enough around the house - says wife laying in bed with dog, watching TV with a coke. I'll finish off kitchen & do ironing then!

In the gym, trying to make more progress than I managed last week #muststopsnacking

"I've got 8 little fingers and only 2 thumbs, why don't you leave me in peace whilst I get the job done" - Chris Rea #customerstakenote

Just finished housework and realised that the weekend is over. Have missed England, all Sat pm TV, 2 mins silence, Grand Prix & IACFMOOH

Unbelievable. I work for a company where we have teams fighting against each other to get the same client. This has just cost me business.

@burchelledward. I hope the Bruce brothers get everything they deserve ie nothing but shit #whatgoesaroundcomesaround

@kristianderrick I heard, on reliable sources, it was ¬£1. This is the same as they bought Ashley Adams for. #whatgoesaroundcomesaround

@UORnews That I could obtain a Visa to emigrate to the US.

Can anyone become a Tibetan monk?  I quite fancy escaping the daily grind. Either that or deckchair attendant on Miami beach.

@DisneyParks Magic Kingdom, as it was the only park around when I first visited WDW in 1979.

@sarah_cawood I end up most days thinking exactly the same (perhaps swap the carbs for a can if coke!).

@DisneyParks Just being there is a start. Add sunny weather, some theme park food, and staying one step ahead of the crowd and I'm sorted!

Lloyds TSB announce large losses due to 'exceptional costs and lower income'. Isn't that why most companies make losses? #statingtheobvious

@DisneyParks I think I'd go to the Studios today.

NatWest - get more cashiers in. I am busy and don't find standing in your banking hall a good use of my time.

If you die without having a will you die intestate. Why does having a will stop you from dying when testing what you're eating?

Today, I am seriously considering jacking work in, buying a one way ticket to the US, hiring a Harley and never coming back #fedup

@WaltDisneyWorld On the basis of Space Mountain, Buzz, Mission Space, Spaceship Earth (loosely), TTA (more loosely) I'd go for Rocket Ship.

@WaltDisneyWorld @disneyparks  Being in the UK all are international to me. I've done WDW and Disneyland Paris, & want to visit all the rest

@AnnaSianFeeney @bigwes   Is there a danger of @bigwes becoming a more famous #NFFC fan than Ebby?

@WaltDisneyWorld   Nighttime parades. I prefer everything about WDW at night.

‚Äú@MensHealthUK: Are you having enough sex? Find out here http://t.co/uJZNVVXp‚Äù. Bad news. I score 0.04 out of an ideal of 1 #depressed

My life is being eroded by mundane conference calls, when I have lots to do.

@DisneyParks Ice cream parlour at the end of main street.

Just watched Hurt Locker. If that film is true to life, our soldiers need massive payrises & to be treated like stars when they return home

@DisneyParks First attraction I visit is Rock'n'Roller Coaster, but that's to get a Fastpass. Then I'd go straight to ride Tower of Terror.
