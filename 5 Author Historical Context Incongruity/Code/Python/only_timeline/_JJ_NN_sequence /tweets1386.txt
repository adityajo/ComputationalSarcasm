@LilWiley2 Heck yes! I'll probably end up hitting the slopes next Tuesday if you would like to join. Just let me know! #snowboarding

Oil change, haircut, racquetball, and @RUFWCU Not-A-Date Night. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's going to be a very good Friday #Yes

@JadaRachel saw your tweet about your late-night homework session. All I could do was laugh

With a beautiful day up ahead tomorrow, I plan to wear my @TOMS. It has been a while #OneForOne

@RUFWCU Was amazing as always. It is impossible for us to feel a full sense of belonging on Earth, but Jesus has prepared a place for us.

#AwesomeSauce! “@RUFWCU: RUF tonight at 8pm on the 3rd floor of the UC in Illusions! The topic will be LIFE. Come and hang out!”

RT @RunningQuotes: Not every race is perfect, not every run is perfect. Getting out there, is perfect

RT @thenorthface: Such a sad loss for the skiing community. Rest in peace, Sarah.

Something random I just thought about that I learned as a freshman @WCU. Don't judge the temperature outside by what people are wearing

@Claire_McCray It is sad that it has come to the point that knowing the difference between "your" and "you're" is impressive

Off to the CRC to go climbing before @RUFWCU tonight. Come join us at 8pm on the third floor of the UC in Illusions!

Feeling lucky to have a legit climbing wall here @WCU. Got an awesome day of climbing in. Way to get to the top @leslieweiner!
