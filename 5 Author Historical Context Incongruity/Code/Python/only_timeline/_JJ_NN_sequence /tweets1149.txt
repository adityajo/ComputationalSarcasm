@james_in_to just gotta win the other games in the series. Easy peasy

@dru0887 yes. That's why they became beer drinkers.

@gregorMLB @eskimo_irl good thing they didn't wait for them to come back on üòè

@james_in_to remember those games when the Rays would light up Doc for no damn reason in the middle of a stellar season? I think we're owed

@james_in_to Archer has got to have one stinker in him this year.. Tonight would be nice

@BKennedyStar it's worth the risk to pay large for Cueto and Chapman IMO. Now's the time. Jose's and Edwin aren't Benjamin Button.

@TimBontemps think Masai can fleece the Kings again? Maybe JV, Ross, Bruno &amp; 20?

@Chris_Toutant wtf? Autocorrect.. You're not ALONE THERE I wouldn't say. Is what that should have said..

Side effects of taking in @BlueJays baseball could include but not limited to; Hypertension, Stroke, Vomiting, Elation, Depression, etc.

@Chris_Toutant haha, you're not allowed me there I wouldn't say.

@AHume92 perhaps. Haha naw man, just messin around.

@AHume92 how do you know what I do or don't know? üòè

@gregorMLB is it too simplistic to say it's a lack of focus? That's the way it seems.

@james_in_to that made no sense, they're all against Jays. Haha

@james_in_to that's at least 8. 5 against Jays, 3 for Rays.

Were those missed strikes on Navarro or Danley that inning? #MLBatBat #CantSee @james_in_to @Baseball_Jenn

@TravisDakin not the change you're looking for I'm afraid..

@SMartee2525 @Baseball_Jenn @MikeHradil @TJellyn me three

@james_in_to this might benefit them later this season. Nudge AA to give up something to get something.

@Baseball_Jenn @MikeHradil @TJellyn @SMartee2525 if Gibby was marching Miller &amp; Robertson out there.......

@TJellyn @Baseball_Jenn @SMartee2525 @MikeHradil I ask for lots of things I don't get, and that I probably couldn't handle.

@Baseball_Jenn @SMartee2525 @MikeHradil @TJellyn it's simple. He's not a closer, he's a situational lefty who's miscast right now. #sendhelp

@TravisDakin he'd better do something soon. Don't let this offence go to waste! Mid-rotation starter and good bullpen arm would work

@Hoodlum0404 this we can definitely agree on! üëçüèª

@TravisDakin Papelbon.. Rodriguez.. Clippard.... Cecil isn't a closer. He's proven that. He's a situational lefty who's thrived in that role

@james_in_to it he top spin and was at least 8-10 feet to his left. No chance. People are fucking stupid

@TravisDakin I miss Tom Henke.

@dr_w83 naw man, it split them, lots of top spin. Just perfectly placed.

@dr_w83 that had nothing to do with him, it was 8 feet to his left.

@Baseball_Jenn 3 up 3 down top of 9, first pitch bomb for Smoak. I can't handle much more of this.. #Stress

@dr_w83 it's a different look that's for sure

@dr_w83 it's a great place to watch a game! Gets a bad rap but I love it! (I may be bias)

@dr_w83 did you enjoy yourself anyway? They brought the tying run to the plate with their best hitters up at least..

@dr_w83 game of inches bro.. Almost had a 3 run bomb and a slam in that inning. Different day it's a much different outcome.. It happens

@james_in_to so go Cleveland Klubers and Detroit Cabreras!!

@james_in_to fair enough.

@james_in_to I'm still not convinced that Navarro's blast wasn't a homerun. To me it looks like it went behind the screen..

@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten just missed two grand slams.. Shit happens

RT @Baseball_Jenn: At the very least. #BlueJays  https://t.co/OWhF1GeuOt

@JaysManInWhite don't get me wrong. Some great writers in Toronto! But guys like Simmons, Cox, and now Griffin can be hard on the head!

@JaysManInWhite I was speaking generally. They need to find controversy regardless of team or sport. If there isn't one they'll make one.

@james_in_to @JaysManInWhite @Baseball_Jenn Toronto media needs to find something shitty to talk about regardless how well team is doing.

@ShiDavidi how many pitches you think they'll let him go assuming this continues? 125? 130?

@HumandChuck I have no problem with that, just do it on 10 pitches and not 18.

@ShiDavidi haha this is your best spelling error of all time!

@TravisDakin hahahah that's cute!

@james_in_to I don't like everything he says, but I love the trade idea with the Reds! :) (in my wildest dreams) but still

@AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith this is Jim Bowdens trade proposition for the Jays! If this was possible.. 1000x yes! http://t.co/MSf6c8abAl

@AndrewStoeten @npsport #BIRDSALLDAY if you had to give up one of Norris, Hoffman, Sanchez to get a stud (Cueto or =), who do you give?

@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten @DrewGROF Goins will be great to have on the bench. Get Reyes off his feet in blowouts and every 10 days or so

@james_in_to he's gotta be hurting, no? Those pitches are crushable!

@tylerspitzer1 @Hoodlum0404 sorry Dad! Geez

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 than a cleverly timed joke? You were correct.

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 I thought we were typing illogical shit.. My bad

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 Hahaha it's funny because you're serious! He dragged them on his back to a place they had no business being!

@Baseball_Jenn agreed

@Baseball_Jenn true. But if they wait for the next Noah, Jose x 2 &amp; Edwin will be gone.

@Baseball_Jenn Baseball.

@TravisDakin good thing they weren't gonna go undefeated the rest of the season eh?

@Hoodlum0404 *cough "try" baseball. Aka avoid a league embarrassment and a suspension for gambling. (But I agree, he would've)

@Hoodlum0404 that's because he's the GOAT.

@Hoodlum0404 6 in 14 years. Best Lebron can do is 5 in 14. That would still be pretty good assuming he wins them.

@james_in_to is it greedy if I want this one to make it to 21?

@dr_w83 "No THIRD baseman! Not left-baseman, not infield defensemen." "Also, Russell is NOT a goalie!"

@dr_w83 I would also like it if they coughed up some dough to add a couple pitchers in trade!

@dr_w83 tbh, I like the fact that Rogers has their employees campaigning for their players! He definitely deserves it.

@dr_w83 bahaha but he plays like a Canadian!

@dr_w83 Josh isn't THAT foreign.. It's not like he's Russian or Swedish..

@dr_w83 ha! He's very well aware of what he's doing, He knows where his bread is buttered!

@james_in_to @ekoreen to be fair, I've heard him talk Jays long before he was a Rogers employee, which is the drum you're beating, loudly!

RT @SBNationNBA: Why is LeBron still feeling confident? "Because I'm the best player in the world" http://t.co/W8JHOek4EW https://t.co/q7iY‚Ä¶

@james_in_to I'd say Pitt but their division is tough. So Cleveland

@dr_w83 @TravisDakin I'd argue they're getting plenty of work! #Heyo

@dr_w83 @TravisDakin the rotation has been solid lately. I'd improve the pen first.

RT @ThrowinSmoke: My fave GIF and it's not even close  https://t.co/wAyhS5XADC

@ThrowinSmoke I hate those guys! Just yell "get on my level bro!" And knock his beer out of his hands.

@HumandChuck they could've gone with just the video.. I can do my own play by play

@HumandChuck Matt Devlin did a great job filling in last year imo

@dr_w83 "Hey Moron! Throw strikes! Nothing they can hit tho!" *sips diet coke* *that'll get it done*

@dr_w83 fuck that 8 game win streak! I wanna be angry! #Retards #GibbonsFault

@james_in_to it was a great throw and he almost beat it anyway.. I'm fine with it. #DontCallMeJerry

RT @magic_uno: I feel ya, Bron. @bomani_jones http://t.co/vUlTdNBLXW

@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten keyword = sense.

@james_in_to @financialuproar 266 BILLION??!? Wtf?

@james_in_to I haven't seen a Devon Travis update lately.. Have you?

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 who was?

@james_in_to the best part is him brushing off Barry on his way down the dugout steps and the look on Barry's face! üòÇ

I think my favourite part of this @BlueJays win was @SNBarryDavis's face trying to nab Edwin after his walkoff! #GoodLuck üòÇüòÇ

@james_in_to people are way overreacting to this. Way way overreacting.

@MikeCormack @michaelgrange don't lose sight of the big picture because of one week. If doing this means Sanchez can pitch in Sept/Oct? üëçüèªüëåüèª

@DrewGROF how about the third strike he threw down and away that was called a ball? Compliments of Navarro and Angel.

@james_in_to he's such a piece of trash! Totally jobbed Osuna twice in three batters.

@dr_w83 what an idiot for PHing Kawasaki to start that inning! #OhWait

@AndrewStoeten why? Who are we trading him for? Howarth doesn't like him either? üòè

@bnicholsonsmith @FAN590 Reyes is awesome and if he's run out of town I doubt people would like a full season of Goins!

@pgammo you're really not this stupid, right?

@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten and for the record, I think he'd be a great LF. Good wheels and still has a strong arm.

@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten ya I was kinda hoping Travis would be in there too.. Soon

@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to u rather have Carrera &amp; Pillar in the outfield with JB or Reyes in left with Goins at short &amp; 1 of the other 2?

@AndrewStoeten @BlueJayHunter nonsense. Buck &amp; Tabby can be hard on the head but they're miles better than that crap!

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 sorry I missed that, I was outside and my phone would've been soaked had I taken it out. #PouringRain

@dr_w83 @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 @bejarv @Hoodlum0404 I've got two Lawrie jerseys.. Canada day and an autographed home.. Great investment

@dr_w83 @tylerspitzer1 @bejarv @TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 I do have one, authentic home Romero

@dr_w83 or some new skin, he could probably afford that

@dr_w83 he paid for that way before he was highly paid

@MyMcMurray did they give a specific lane?? That would help

@BKennedyStar bahaha I was hip for a minute there damn it! That's so ratchet? #IThinkImDoingThisWrong

@BKennedyStar I'm not sure how the hell sign gets autocorrected to "dig it" but you get the point.

@BKennedyStar back on the field. Kid was stoked, vultures not so much. I liked Reyes even more after that, made a point to get the real fan

@BKennedyStar Reyes comes over to dig it for him and he nearly got trampled by the mop, Reyes signed for him, shook his head and marched

@BKennedyStar they're the worst! I was in Seattle last year and this little kid was wearing a Reyes jersey standing down by the field,

@ByChrisBlack @michaelgrange looked great on paper. Lots of work done that offseason. Since then tho, different story

@ByChrisBlack @michaelgrange to be fair, I think they tried to address it with the Marlins trade. Dickey Johnson Buerhle Morrow &amp; Romero

@bnicholsonsmith I would stop that list at Osuna Cecil

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 I'll take Mike Trout tho. And Richards and Street.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 Rivera ain't marching out of that bullpen. Neither is Henke or Ward for that matter.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 the bullpen. If that guy doesn't get the job done, how is that on you? Especially if you have no options?

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 in all other sports, you're 100% right, coaches dictate a playing style, run systems, etc etc. in baseball you call

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 their effect on a game is minimal. You play with the hand your dealt. You think Joe Torre was a god too?

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 how many World Series has mike Scioscia won? One. In 16 years. He's fucking amazing right? You know why he won? K-Rod.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 precisely

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 that dead horse you're kicking, it died a long time ago. When people believed in shit like culture.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 the Giants didn't win a World Series with culture. They won with a stud pitcher, a solid bullpen, and good defence.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 dude, that's how baseball works. You score runs, get a lead, and your bullpen locks it down. Theoretically at least

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 how many teams do you watch that score in all 9 innings??

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 pitching and defence wins. Period. Always has. Always will.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 when has he had the talent to compete? The Jays have had a great offended for years. They can score runs.

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 culture is such overplayed bullshit. When you're winning you have good culture, when you're not, you don't.

@dr_w83 @Hoodlum0404 Talent wins. They have very little in the pen. Management gambled on not improving the pen and so far it isn't working.

@Hoodlum0404 so the Royals had good "culture" last year right? It wasn't their dominating, stud laden bullpen?

@Hoodlum0404 you can't blame the chef when he didn't buy the groceries.. And the groceries went bad a year ago. #BullpenSucks #NotGibbons

@AndrewStoeten "I never had a WAR, I just fought in 7 of them. Har Har Har." "BABIP? Is that a kids elephant show?"

@AndrewStoeten @Mentoch you misspelled June, Andrew.

@james_in_to extra day of rest right?

@HumandChuck never read that shit! It'll make your eyes bleed

@james_in_to my order of lament is completing different. Unsigned FA's.

@AndrewStoeten @MikeDiGiovanna don't you mean Foo Like symptoms?

@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten could we have Chapman too? I mean, may as well..

@pbroos1 @AndrewStoeten I got your point, I was being funny. It's early, I forgive you

@pbroos1 @AndrewStoeten he was a poorly portrayed journalist before he was a Twitter troll FYI.

@dr_w83 I put my life in so many people's hands on a daily basis, many of which I'm sure are clinically insane! Crazy when you think bout it

@dr_w83 it's ok, it's late #nightshift

@dr_w83 I was making funnies.. Which should have resulted in hearty chuckles.. I'll try again later

@SkySportsNewsHQ @dr_w83 so they're the Calgary Flames?

@Hoodlum0404 @dr_w83 @Toddske you guys don't think Tampa made out good in that deal? Callahan has been good for them no?

@Baseball_Jenn because you're waiting for the day when Wilner just loses his shit, cusses everyone out, throws the mic down, &amp; marches out?

@BKennedyStar @bluebirdbanter bottom line, for a team that is second in MLB in runs scored/game they aren't winning nearly enough.

@dr_w83 how much do you suppose it would cost us to open a refinery? How big is your new lot? :)

@Hoodlum0404 some fight? üòè

@ShiDavidi are you sure it didn't occur watching the pitching staff?

@tylerspitzer1 @Hoodlum0404 you wanna drive some out to work for me? Get a little cooler.. Maybe throw a beer or two in with it..

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 I respectfully disagree

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 it kind of is whether you realize it or not, you're saying they should come back and win. Tonight that would = 7

@BKennedyStar I believe it's called "OurPitchingKindaSucksAndWeFeelLikeWeNeed30RunsToWin-Itis"

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 FYI, "good teams" don't need to score 10 runs a night to win.

@tylerspitzer1 @Hoodlum0404 you're very observant.. ;)

@Hoodlum0404 two starters and a closer solves a lot. Way way way easier said than done. Also, what do you give up for all that?

@HumandChuck let's be honest, is this a surprise? Everyone knew what their weaknesses were.

@Hoodlum0404 their starters era is shit as well. While pitching staff has major holes

@Hoodlum0404 it wears on an offence when you score a bunch of runs and the pitching staff gives it right back. It's not just the bullpen.

@brianmctaggart @TonyRasmusIV let's not be hasty.. Francis is giving up a .350 BAA against LHH. Not exactly Aroldis Chapman

@Hoodlum0404 the problem is pretty evident, their pitching staff sucks balls right now. That's it. They're second in MLB in runs scored/game

@Hoodlum0404 @BlueJays although I don't think it's the problem, if they keep this up (or down depending on perspective), somebody gets fired

@james_in_to Zaun will probably say they need to trade for a LHH to break up the righties.. He'll give up Reyes since we have Goins

@TravisDakin it's only May.. Oh you said that already! üòè

@dr_w83 what???! Mad jelly

@stackmack like what? Like the Raptors? üòè

@AndrewStoeten fuck. Off.

@james_in_to jam sandwich.. Shitty walk.. Eleventeen hopper over first.. Oppo slice double..

@ThrowinSmoke üê£?üê•? Damn no duck emoji

@DrewGROF the thing is, he seems to work his way out of it most of the time. He'll learn

@dr_w83 correct :)

@TravisDakin @Hey_RobC who knew that's what khia was singing about this whole time?

@dr_w83 Si Si (CC what I did there?)

@dr_w83 the dude can actually hit. He's a late bloomer but he's had some success.

@james_in_to that's why he's not on mine

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin correct!

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin I've thought about it.. Subsidized housing, steady income, start a drug habit maybe.. Seems like a good life

@Hoodlum0404 I won't

@TravisDakin I'm not

@KyleHarrietha God help us

@bruce_arthur it was good while it lasted Alberta.. Socialism for everyone! #ShootMe

@Baseball_Jenn you have a better win % than the Jays so that's something..

@james_in_to so who gets sent down after today's game? #BuffaloExpress

@bnicholsonsmith @SNBarryDavis so if they don't use anymore....

@james_in_to he barely missed that pitch.. Man how I wish he was locked in right now

@RGriffinStar it looked foul for sure.. Woulda been nice to clear the bottom of the lineup if nothing else

@dr_w83 @SLShockeyfan yes they've fucked up more than one province. They have practice so they should do Alberta rather efficiently!

@bruce_arthur @RobSilver @jengerson God help us all if it happens

@dr_w83 it's so unbelievable that sometimes I can't help myself.. I get dragged into trying to educate people.. So painful

@dr_w83 some people have way too much time on their hands.. If you ever accidentally start reading comment sections.. God help us all!

@dr_w83 because outdoor baseball is fun. As for the ones not actually attending, no clue!

@dr_w83 @Lrning2Fly well you're getting some raw shaw dog!

@dr_w83 @Lrning2Fly unless you're paying the highest price for their highest speed...

@james_in_to even more RH'd if it is Smoak. Feel for the guy, didn't really get a shot.

RT @CountOnVic: James Harden's mom got fouled out while giving birth to him.

@james_in_to He's still trying to do a good job! Maybe if there was a little more turnover and some real accountability this would be better

@Baseball_Jenn they've had their chances. Great chances.

@AndrewStoeten well it's been a month right? He's gonna bust out soon right? Right? JB too right? Right? 20 runs/game right? Right?

@AndrewStoeten I know how much you like to play Doctor.. You think his back is still fucked?

@james_in_to pretty shitty.. It'll be nice when they get it going! Hopefully sooner rather than later

@james_in_to the list of the ones I don't is way easier to inventory

@james_in_to that would be so worth the suspension!

@bnicholsonsmith dang! Did he hit someone?

@tylerspitzer1 @YoungBradYMM be OK

@tylerspitzer1 @YoungBradYMM you're both entitled to your opinions, that's the beauty of it. IMO, if we don't end up Blue or Orange we'll

@YoungBradYMM @tylerspitzer1 @Mix1037FMNews @Mix1037radio because the other choices are so wonderful? Get a grip

@tylerspitzer1 @Mix1037FMNews @Mix1037radio I'll take it.

@YoungBradYMM @KyleHarrietha @ABLiberal boy do I feel dumb

@KyleHarrietha seen a sign or heard from a member of your party. That's somewhat alarming to me.

@KyleHarrietha I like where the Liberal party currently stands, and I'd like to vote for you, but one day before elections and I haven't

@keithlaw @diegogflores who's the best manager working or not in your opinion? (Still alive)

@DrewGROF @jonahkeri thank god there's no team that can be related to Special Agent Oso or else I'd be in trouble

@BKennedyStar how is this supposed to make the starters go deeper into games?

@james_in_to or the bats get frustrated and check out mentally

@bnicholsonsmith which proves, you can hit all you want but if you can't pitch it doesn't matter.

@HumandChuck that depends. If they sweep the homestand, sure, if they continue to suck, no.

@AndrewStoeten it's been pretty HorrAwful to this point so I suppose you're right. It can only get better.

@AndrewStoeten do we know that tho? Seriously

@DrewGROF hey remember when they had a 6-1 lead? Remember when they had pitchers who could make that stand up? That was fun

@james_in_to hahah I'm chuckling now! It's hilarious how bad it is

@Baseball_Jenn let's win 15-13 maybe?

@Alleycat17 don't be sad. It's kind of funny if you have a really dark sense of humour.. Ok it's not. It's pathetic

@keithlaw you missed nothing new. The atrocity that is the #Jays pitching staff has continued to be unbearable.

@Baseball_Jenn Lineup is amazing. And will be better. Pitching is a tire fire.

@Baseball_Jenn I took it as a whole.. It's the pitching. Which has been so awful it's hurts my eyes.

@james_in_to if Hutch doesn't pitch like shit he doesn't need to be saved with an awesome defensive play

@Baseball_Jenn I think you mean get it together #BlueJays starters. Have been pretty terrible all season..

@james_in_to Hutch has been anything but sharp tho and can't have a shut down inning to save his life.

@HumandChuck and bad base running by Saunders. He stopped and started on the way home.. All in all a huge waste

@HumandChuck deff would have made him throw at least one strike

@james_in_to it's Sunday Morning.. Maybe he was headed for some of Zaun's roast.. üòè

@dr_w83 @tylerspitzer1 they scare me. They're too unpredictable and I would rather see anybody else quite frankly.

@dr_w83 @tylerspitzer1 and they are slimy. They prey on the weak and get most of their support from welfare seekers etc

@dr_w83 @tylerspitzer1 140 characters isn't nearly enough. I will say coming from Ontario I've watched the NDP operate for a long time

@dr_w83 @tylerspitzer1 it's not

@tylerspitzer1 God help us all if NDP gets in..

@DrewGROF true, the bullpen has lost at least 4 games tho.

@DrewGROF I kinda wonder what the Jays record would be if Miller took their money instead?

@james_in_to @GuzmansJhercurl that's a bullshit explanation! I rarely see him complain unless it's a ball. In which case he has legit beef!

@james_in_to nice

@james_in_to oh I missed that yesterday! Nevermind haha

@james_in_to this has got to be a Castro inning coming up, no?

@DrewGROF a little assist from Pedro and Harold Reynolds

@bnicholsonsmith does that mean Bautista is ready to go back to right? I thought he wasn't even throwing yet

@Baseball_Jenn ya, hopefully it's the rotation giving 6-7 inning outings on a regular basis.

@ShiDavidi well at least they gave Dalton a month... #KneeJerk

@dr_w83 you don't say? It never fails.. I pause and wait for silence in that situation

@THEKIDMERO or the ass

@AndrewStoeten no, I'm sure he'll retire at some point. üòè

@AndrewStoeten so you want Lohse?

@AndrewStoeten Simmons &lt; Simmons. (They're interchangeable)

@AndrewStoeten but he's so smart...

@Ken_Rosenthal if Travis wasn't beat up &amp; Reyes on the DL you'd never see this.

@james_in_to I was hoping they'd give the young guys at least 10 starts to get settled..

@james_in_to Devon to DL with broken collarbone.. I don't want that but...

@dr_w83 @50_MissionCap bastard!

@dr_w83 he's number two! üí©

@james_in_to I don't know but unless it's an injury it seems premature.

@jonahkeri it's like watching the replay in real time

@baseballexis uh what? For who?

@james_in_to is it greedy if I want a 13 game winning streak?

@james_in_to why is there an option to translate from Indonesian?? http://t.co/9ogk6rUKjD

@dr_w83 don't they need to be down 3 anyway? I thought that was their magic comeback number..? #3Xin88Games

@tylerspitzer1 @dr_w83 Caps Blackhawks is my wish..

@dr_w83 @tylerspitzer1 I love how you guys are relishing this!! This is gonna be a public beating, not a series. How bout those Caps tho?

@james_in_to people who know nothing about baseball?

@haralabob they also killed Bellinelli's hot hand

@dr_w83 @highlandkrayg oh damn son! Grapefruit balls?

@dr_w83 @highlandkrayg thank you! The kid in the stall next to me shrieking for his dad to come wipe his ass was the icing on the cake

@dr_w83 @highlandkrayg yesterday.. It happened.. It was just as terrible as I thought it would be!

@highlandkrayg the worst poops are had at Walmart

@AndrewStoeten he tells the best stories during the broadcast.. I love it

@bluebirdbanter I push the last of my chips to the middle and acquire Papelbon.

@gregorMLB ahh I see what you're getting at. My bad

@gregorMLB @ShiDavidi @LottOnBaseball they won 7 of 9 last year in Boston

@TimBontemps they also show how frustrating he can be to watch when he's not playing that way.

@Baseball_Jenn it makes sense. He doesn't look comfortable at all and I'd rather see him healthy than playing like this..

@stackmack their defence has been incredible!

@gregorMLB if anyone is surprised that the rotation isn't going deep into games or the pen has struggled, they're lying to themselves.

@james_in_to very interesting.. Prob very different

@TheGarfoose hi I'm #CaptainObvious

@TheGarfoose those people hate kittens and puppies.

@james_in_to would people rather he used Liam?? I think not.. Might see Delabar soon tho

@james_in_to the theme is the inability to hold leads. Regardless how it's happening.

@james_in_to Reyes hit would have scored one at least.

@HumandChuck not pretty.

@james_in_to unless it's a movie about disappointing sports.....

RT @the_Zubes: The more sports you watch in Toronto, the more sense it makes that a guy dug a hole in the middle of a park just to be alone.

@bruce_arthur TFC won tonight..

@ekoreen let's be honest, they don't know where they are.

@Eric__Smith do they have to come out of the locker room? Or can they just forfeit?

@LeoRautins @Raptors they need to play D! They can't stop them at all.. It's kinda sad to watch actually

@gregorMLB agreed. They were playing over their heads. They aren't this bad tho.. They can't be

@WolstatSun Lowry illness game??

@Middaughsome @james_in_to Reminds me of Juan Francisco situation.. Except he plays great D

@Hoodlum0404 @BlueJays I will continue to say them.

@james_in_to watching Archer stay in the dugout to start the 8th on the other hand....

@james_in_to that's only for Tampa to do. Don't you know anything?

@ShiDavidi a lot of weird things happening this series..

@BKennedyStar this stadium is even messing with the umps..

@ThrowinSmoke House of Horrors to be sure! What a dump

@BKennedyStar he didn't have a good grip on it based on the replay..

@JimBowden_ESPN Jays! If he came with a side of Hamels that would be great too.

@james_in_to that sounds heavenly

@james_in_to are they deepthroating Archer too?

@james_in_to just score some damn runs and this shit is irrelevant

@HumandChuck I'm convinced they do the broadcast for people with Alzheimer's.

@james_in_to I agree man. They need to sacrifice a goat or something... Maybe a Ray!?

@HumandChuck I really hope the Jays score some damn runs because I don't want to hear how great Archer is for the next 2 hours

@BKennedyStar was he called off? He's not gonna back off unless he's called off the ball you'd think

@james_in_to my hope is he doesn't make it out of the first... :)

@james_in_to just gotta hang tough until EE &amp; Joey get hot. At that point I foresee a run.

@Baseball_Jenn he doesn't know when to shut up.. This doesn't surprise anybody. I wish they could hire Delgado or VW or someone..

@piersmorgan 3 uncalled penalties too! üòè

@BlueJays are 1 game back in their division and haven't got it rolling at all yet. Lots of ball left. Good things to come! #Jays

@JaysManInWhite where the fuck were you for the add on runs? Wouldn't have been a problem if you showed up

@tylerspitzer1 I'd enjoy that matchup too! It'd be cool to see the Islanders go all the way.. Blackhawks Islanders final!

@tylerspitzer1 whatta bout the east?

Hawks &amp; Ducks WCF? @tylerspitzer1

@Hoodlum0404 I don't think you have to worry about that..

@AndrewStoeten defensible moves to be sure. I personally would've like to see Osuna get a chance to record that third out tho.. #MondayQB

@james_in_to right? Add on runs and this whole thing never happens.. Osuna stays in game, retires DeJesus. 123 ninth.

@james_in_to nope.

@HumandChuck this loss is on Gibbons. I rarely say that but it's true today.

@ShiDavidi I think you're way overselling this. That didn't seem like a catchable ball and he was deep.

@james_in_to I love it! Gotta let them work it out

@BKennedyStar Meals with the assist..

@HumandChuck TV dive

@HumandChuck I know. The Rays just drive me nuts..

@HumandChuck he's a Ray now so he's automatically annoyingly good against the Jays.

@CaseyStern inept

@Eric__Smith last year could be chalked up to learning and they actually almost won that series... What do we call this?

@bluebirdbanter it absolutely is. Most balanced bench in a long time for this team, especially when Navarro comes back.

@WolstatSun you don't think he gets a chance to coach Wiggins and Tristan after they acquire them in the offseason? üòè

@ShiDavidi what does that mean exactly?

@james_in_to maybe. I think they want the best infield option tho and that's Goins. This lines up as their best balanced bench imo

@Hoodlum0404 I'm extremely disappointed in the effort level on defence mostly.. That's where they have to win the game

@Hoodlum0404 I know what you meant dude.. I was making funny's

@Hoodlum0404 doesn't look like much shooting was happening in practice.. Or running for that matter..

@gregorMLB Francis saved the bullpen tho and that's not nothing.. #BrightSide

@Hoodlum0404 you'll probably only have to worry about that one more time....

@james_in_to 2 outta 3 ain't bad.. That's all they need for payback.. :)

@james_in_to he didn't have it tonight. Could've easily went much better tho. Moving on.

@james_in_to and catch a complete game shutout

@dr_w83 @Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @Lrning2Fly finally got the Old Boys club pushed aside! That is pretty awesome even for me and IDGAF

@dr_w83 @Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @Lrning2Fly are your Oilers boners a little stiffer today?

@bluebirdbanter well he didn't cower. He didn't walk him. And he wasn't afraid to challenge the next two guys. All positives in my book.

@bluebirdbanter I hope that's a joke.

@bluebirdbanter meh. That's on Liam. Castro did what he was supposed to. Challenge with the lead

@bnicholsonsmith it was obliterated, that's for sure!

@AndrewStoeten also everyone who doesn't keep their phone on vibrate at all times.

@james_in_to agreed! It's a smart way to include everyone and keep things light and tight!

@james_in_to all great things to work out in week 2! You don't want those issues dragging into July!

@HumandChuck I think it's awesome! Nobody gets left out. Happiness abounds.

@james_in_to he deff made the right call, they won! :)

@james_in_to I think he should just be left out there to figure it out. I would have let him try and get out of the 6th today but that's me

@Hoodlum0404 I believe he's still at extended spring training and then will start in AA. He had knee surgery from what I remember

I deff get the AJ Burnett comparison so far tonight! 1 hit 5 walks. @AndrewStoeten

@TimBontemps @kevinarnovitz not necessarily.. If you're on military time and it's flashing 12:00....

@MLBNetworkRadio @CaseyStern @JimBowden_ESPN throwback to Bernie Williams retiring 9 years ago... Oh wait

@CaseyStern JoeyBats isn't a fan of the Orioles pitching staff. #CaptainObvious #InsidePitch

@james_in_to or jerking off watching his homerun! That I would believe too!

@RGriffinStar @saberfeed @SNJeffBlair @GreggZaun @drunkjaysfans @bluebirdbanter this is precisely why I root for him! Rises to the occasion

@ekoreen if it was i hope it's because they signed Lemarcus Aldridge.

@CaseyStern @JoeyBats19 if there's ever a time pimpin a homer is appropriate, it's then!

@AndrewStoeten you can make turnip edible with butter.. Pick something worse

RT @BlueJayHunter: 1.) After Bautista was thrown at.

@HumandChuck they should be giving their own pitcher shit. Period. It's so fucking dumb for them to be upset about the pimpin'! #PimpOnPimp

Best game recap ever. Ever. Excellent work. Maybe your best! *crotch grab to you @AndrewStoeten* https://t.co/abfIUHHlkI

@bnicholsonsmith did you say "Oh fuck off!"? Because that would seem like an appropriate response

Nobody gets locked in like @JoeyBats19 after they've been throw at! @Encadwin launching bombs into outer space! #LockedandLoaded

@bluebirdbanter he's not in the game until Zaun says he's in the game! No respect for the suited warrior..

@HumandChuck @TSNScottyMac let's hope he doesn't figure it out for one more night.. Or the rest of the season

@RMWoodBuffalo it's amazing to me that people still need to be convinced to participate in the census!

@danieltosh and if he's right?

@drdoubleyew thank fuck for that! Hahaha

@drdoubleyew I'd say! Catapulted into the spotlight big time

@drdoubleyew the panel seemed to think he wouldn't take the position without immunity in decision making

@drdoubleyew I would think that's a good thing..

@drdoubleyew I agree wholeheartedly. I heard them talking last night that Nicholson has pretty much been handed the reigns. Did I hear that?

@drdoubleyew I think anyone who came in would start from scratch with a staff

@drdoubleyew if you had your pick of the litter who would take to right the ship in Etown?

@drdoubleyew thickwood. Fucking guy, why'd he switch?

@drdoubleyew not yet, I did buy a membership yesterday tho so I'll get a few in I hope!

@TimBontemps don't they attack you any time you say anything? Which is fair because obviously you know nothing! üòâ

@drdoubleyew he's special all right..

@drdoubleyew me OSO &amp; Ashlynn..

@TimBontemps @Nibbs_1 ya but they're mediocre all stars! üòè

@drdoubleyew obvi!

@TimBontemps ya that tech was a pretty big swing.. 4 points sorta kinda..

@AndrewStoeten @BenBadler that is f******* epic!!

@Hoodlum0404 @bruce_arthur maybe, I just think her head was right on it almost

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @bruce_arthur they said she was conscious

@Hoodlum0404 @bruce_arthur it bounced back onto the field because it never went through.

@Hoodlum0404 @bruce_arthur watch it again

@Hoodlum0404 @bruce_arthur the netting was there, her head was right next to it.

@james_in_to brutal! The worst ones are the ones that bounce off the second deck facade and come launching back towards people.. Scary

@AnthaV you misspelled crazy

@tylerspitzer1 @simmonssteve he's just a huge troll.

@drdoubleyew I can understand hitting him once.. It was a late slide.. It should have stopped there tho.100mph at his dome 2day was too much

@drdoubleyew no matter what I do I can't stomach cheering for Vancouver... I just can't.. They're so Vancouver.. It's just too Vancouverey

@drdoubleyew all this aside, I will not be any amount of sad if Calgary pounds Vancouver and ousts them from the playoffs.

@drdoubleyew "Here's Jhonny...!!" Hrudey will shout from his chair in the corner... He won't have pants on.. You get the picture

@drdoubleyew hahaha into an empty net no less.. Gretzky could score into an empty net from the top bowl!

@drdoubleyew I thought it was just taint? The sack was all the way in I think..

@Baseball_Jenn haha well it's your last chance(s) üòâ

@JeffPassan Lawrie is gonna go Red Bull on their asses soon

@AndrewStoeten it's kind of incredible that they're leading mlb in runs scored and their best hitters are from locked in..

@Baseball_Jenn banned

@HumandChuck because you have to get on base in order to run on somebody

@Baseball_Jenn it's never an appropriate time. I hate it. I'm just saying, it's not like they're beating the cover off the ball today.

@Baseball_Jenn to be fair, I'm sure they're impacting the on field result very little.. It's still annoying tho

@Hoodlum0404 @BlueJays haha sometimes it feels that way for sure.. I believe this is a much better team tho.. When this lineup gets rolling.

@Hoodlum0404 @BlueJays I hear ya.. But, it's way way way too early for that kind of jibber jabber! 60 games man, 60 games.

@Hoodlum0404 @BlueJays shut your dirty fucking mouth!

@james_in_to it's gonna be no cake walk getting back in this thing either. Miller looks tough.. Lots of ground outs

@james_in_to correct.

@BKennedyStar looked way worse than that.. I'm no doctor but I like to play one on Twitter

@Baseball_Jenn this is where I have mixed feelings about retaliation. There's a big part of me that wants to see Simmons get hit in the ribs

@BKennedyStar it was deff the HBP, he was grabbing the same spot the whole time

@LottOnBaseball might have been a knuckler at him but probably should have been caught

@HumandChuck I beg to differ

@HumandChuck a little less French press on days he starts maybe? üòè

I have a good feeling about @DanielNorris18 today! 7 strong innings in a W for the @BlueJays! #Jays #GetItRolling #GoStreaking

@VernonWells10 big time!

@Hoodlum0404 how do you know he likes women? Rather presumptuous

@TravisDakin only if they give him all the power. All of it. President. GM. Head Coach. Doesn't answer to anyone.

@Hoodlum0404 @drdoubleyew @Lrning2Fly @TravisDakin butttt if you have RNH &amp; Eberle on one line and McDavid &amp; Hall on another... That's sexy

@Hoodlum0404 @Lrning2Fly @drdoubleyew @TravisDakin throw a name out there.. Who do you want??

@drdoubleyew @Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @Lrning2Fly and is their priority a goaltender or a defensemen?

So I ask you loyal Oilers fans, which of this group do they trade now? @drdoubleyew @Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @Lrning2Fly

@drdoubleyew that's like saying Ashlynn tried to drive the car... üòè

@drdoubleyew they did?

@drdoubleyew hahaha do you blame people? I suppose it just speaks to how godawful the oilers have been.. But still haha

@Hoodlum0404 poor bastard, yes he is. Assuming they're smart enough to draft him

@AnthaV Ya, I just found it I think.. CBC

@AnthaV any idea what channel it's on?

@LeoRautins @Raptors the @Raptors have taken the crowd out of the game. I'll give Washington credit but the Raps didn't show up. Period.

Pretty much the worst possible start so far for the @Raptors.. These have been 3 very bad quarters. Need 12 mins of great effort. #RTZ

@BKennedyStar ball 3 to Markakass was strike 3.

Hoooo boyyyy! HERE WE GO!! @Raptors gotta take IT to the Wiz! #RTZ

@jcecil27 people are morons! The block button isn't big enough or fast enough to keep up. I don't blame you. Toronto loves you guys! #GoJays

@GMillerTSN @Raptors win in __ games?

@james_in_to I'm sayin you expose yourself more when they start early in the game. More chances for guys who aren't lights out to be lit up

@james_in_to starters not making it out of the 5th isn't helping things much either..

@drdoubleyew he hits moonshots! What else is he supposed to call himself? BringerOfMoon?

@HumandChuck I say he gets two hits tonight.

Not only do I think the @Raptors will win their 1st round series, I think they have an excellent shot at beating the Hawks in the 2nd round.

This bunting argument on PTS is hurting my brain. Poor Blair is on a logic island surrounded by fools drowning in moronic waters. @FAN590

@james_in_to what a dumbass! Clearly out.

@AndrewStoeten on a different note, I heard Gibby on MLBnetwork saying Reyes may hit RH'd against RHP before they go the DL route..

@AndrewStoeten @HumandChuck I get your point, and it's fair. I just don't think they care if you think it's bullshit.

@AndrewStoeten @HumandChuck hey, I'm not trying to be Gregg Zaun over here.. Some things just don't change.

@AndrewStoeten @HumandChuck like it or not, the game has been played this way for a long long time.

@BlueJays fans, Sea 3-6, Pit 3-6, Mil 2-7, SF 3-8. Early season perspective.

@gregorMLB clear as day it hit his fingers.

@james_in_to telling Archer to STFD!

@HumandChuck Archer has a history of huffy... A long storied one

@jasoncollette @AndrewStoeten clearly not. Or he's bad at his job

RT @fs1otoole: THIS IS REAL: Boss just told us, if this tweet gets 50 thousand retweets, @JayOnrait and I are allowed to grow beards for th‚Ä¶

@james_in_to you're right, either way, naysayers can zip it for another 24 hours.. Woooo

@james_in_to kinda taints a game like this a little, no? Don't get me wrong I love it but a cleaner finish would be ideal.

@james_in_to *hole

@james_in_to that's fair. He did make a nice play in the hope that I thought he had no chance at..

@james_in_to my ideal bench would be Navarro, Goins, Valencia, &amp; Pillar. Tons of options for DHing regulars.

@HumandChuck they will.

@AndrewStoeten I think it was just a different colour. It had pebbles for a different feel though I think

@james_in_to naw, Devo &amp; Reyes will be on base.. 9 rbi's! üòè

@james_in_to I know what you're referring to. Those are my thoughts on it.. Haha

@james_in_to who cares? It's not like they're changing it btwn innings or some shit! If they blew out Tampa in first two this isn't a story.

RT @james_in_to: So is MLB actively monitoring the O-rings at the Trop? How about the fricken hill in centre field at Minute Maid? RF in Ya‚Ä¶

@james_in_to tomorrow they're gonna come out and smash 4 homers and all will be right in the world.. Until they don't..

@james_in_to I quit following him and Barry last summer. I couldn't handle it anymore.

@AndrewStoeten the pitching has been solid. Watch out when they get the bats going!

@BlueJays got home and completely changed their approach at the plate. Pitching has been solid, have to get back to those good ab's. #Jays

@StromansSwag nope. Hate. Get outta here with your logic and reason. I won't have it! üòè

I'd like to see the @BlueJays get back to the approach they had on the road. Death by a thousand singles! #GoOppo

@HumandChuck @Wilnerness590 wow! Epic levels of stupid are out already!

Lets have one of those 4+ run innings now @BlueJays! Take the pressure off the kid a bit. #Jays

@james_in_to I say DFA Liam. If they're serious about keeping the best group that'd be my choice

@HumandChuck it's a stupid argument. EE would usually walk on that pitch or foul it off. Didn't work out, screw it.

@highlandkrayg hahaha it's unavoidable.. It's pretty catchy.. #ImSoOld #INeedANap

@highlandkrayg in unrelated, or somewhat related news, does your kid love the "Yup Yups"? Everything comes to a screeching halt around here

@highlandkrayg if I plug the toilet, I do it like a man! With a huge poop!!

@highlandkrayg what is one square good for anyway?? Even if a chick only does a # 1 they still need 2000 squares minimum!

@bomani_jones every time I ask for coke and the server offers Pepsi, I sigh and ask for water.. From the toilet!

@james_in_to I guarantee you have more thoughts..

@StephR2D2 that pizza was amazing! I don't know how I'd like it now but that's irrelevant

@james_in_to agreed. If he hit into a double play, everyone would be bitching because he didn't send him.

@TravisDakin good pitching will make it look that way. If they win 2 out of 3 all season they're a playoff team.

@GreggZaun @JaysCare how much of a portion?

@BKennedyStar @Baseball_Jenn isn't that repetitive &amp; redundant?

@bomani_jones @KilloughJustin day after is fine too..

@AndrewStoeten Hoffman is hitting 98 regularly?! That makes me kinda giddy!

@hoff_23 I feel ya bro!

@james_in_to I think he's a cranky bastard that knows he's hard pressed to repeat as division champ, whether it's the Jays or Sox..

RT @Hegelbon: well if it isn't my old friend, Kevin Gregg! With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg

RT @julijays: "@BlueJayHunter: Jose Bautista's "tra la la" home run trot is the best. http://t.co/CkWvRNkJgH"

@james_in_to this was by far his best day at the plate this year. Saw a ton of pitches and should have reached four times!

RT @james_in_to: PitchFX on that 2-1 pitch from O'Day http://t.co/BCdpuFnhkb

@Lrning2Fly maybe if they used 40 at the same time...

@james_in_to it's not like the Jays haven't been scoring runs.. Ubaldo has been great.

@HumandChuck second time through the order.. Time for Ubaldo to turn into a pumpkin

@james_in_to this is why Redmond hasn't pitched yet..

@AndrewStoeten and, after week one, I'm more than happy with the Jays end of the deal!

RT @THEKIDMERO: DUSTIN PEDROIA LOOKS LIKE HE HAS MAAAAAD PET FERRETS

RT @Ned2point0: "What a horrible owner." - Frank McCourt, just now, about Arte Moreno

@Chris_Toutant @BlueJays these things sort themselves out. Loup &amp; Cecil will be fine, and the two youngsters look great so far.

@Chris_Toutant @BlueJays to put it in perspective, none of these guys have pitched for over a week. They were a little rusty.

@james_in_to it's almost like they went out and got a bunch of new guys for that exact purpose..

@LeoRautins @Isaiah_Thomas he's so right!

@MLBNetwork why is your radio channel no longer available thru Sirius?

@drdoubleyew I hate you. #NotReally #ButSeriouslyTho

@AndrewStoeten I'm willing to write the entire mess off to the cold piss they were playing in. Martin, Loup, &amp; Cecil. Clean slate.

@james_in_to haha fair enough

@james_in_to what's your prediction for roster moves when Saunders comes back? I say DFA Liam &amp; Tolleson, &amp; call up Goins.

@AndrewStoeten preach!

@james_in_to I hear ya brother.. Norris tomorrow tho! Wooot

@Baseball_Jenn par for the course. If they don't win everyday it's the end of the world. That did suck tho.. Haha

@adnanESPN @gehrig38 @karlravechespn you don't need his approval.

@ShiDavidi base running lessons from Lawrie?

@james_in_to that's two strikes on breaking pitches that would have been balls last year. Makes me smile!

EE! Absolutely crushed! #Edwinging #PLATANOPOWER #ComeTogether #OpeningDay @BlueJays @Encadwin

@BlueJays my daughters ready! #ComeTogether #OpeningDay http://t.co/0SchTLPhrI

@BKennedyStar Navarro in one last stab at being traded told the hitters what was coming. No other explanation for the van beard to be hit.

@drdoubleyew can it fly? Because if it can't fly.....

The @Raptors can't keep anyone in front of them. Bulls are getting to the basket at will. Swiss cheese D. #RTZ @LeoRautins

@steveleggett @SNJeffBlair @HumandChuck this is the opposite. Spring matters for him and he's showing why.

@drdoubleyew that ain't right

@drdoubleyew theeee wheels on the bus go round and round... üé§

@drdoubleyew I hear ya sister

@Hoodlum0404 he's on a program to build up his arm/shoulder. Similar to what they did with McGowan a couple years ago. Prob ready 4 May.

@AndrewStoeten I too, was asleep while this went down. It did not make it easier at all. Now I'm just sad.

@MStrooo6 How is it, zero muscle Buerhle has never been on the DL, and the most fit guy just lost the season?#PapaBuehrle #jokes #StroSmiles

It's a good thing AA cranked up the character this offseason, because they just lost a buttload of talent! @AndrewStoeten

@Eric__Smith they sure seem to have the @Raptors number. Crazy how certain teams match up!

@iainsut he pitched in Colorado

@AndrewStoeten who is that?

@bruce_arthur @keithlaw to be fair, making a crack at her movies and saying she's getting pounded by Lupul is a little different.

@WolstatSun probably because he needs Demar taking and making those shots. When he's going good, Demar takes a lot of "bad" shots.

Ugly loss for the @Raptors tonight. Gotta get it figured out soon or they're gonna be in trouble! The 4 spot in the east won't be fun! #RTZ

@LeoRautins @Eric__Smith these last 4 games are further proof the @Raptors go as Lowry &amp; DeRozan go.

@Chris_Toutant pretty good? The lineup gives opposing pitchers nightmares

@Chris_Toutant nothing significantly better than what they already have

@Chris_Toutant I think they'll do something. Padres have 6 outfielders for example.. Teams out there have surplus.

@Hoodlum0404 zero risk. Potential for pretty decent reward. Martin coaxed Burnett back from garbage heap to a stellar season. #twiceisnice

@Chris_Toutant precisely

@drdoubleyew hence, Miley ass. Which made me gag by the way. The image of her flat back ass... Bleh

@drdoubleyew ya man, they got you geared up pretty good!

@drdoubleyew that was my next guess

@drdoubleyew wtf bro? You got a tape worm or something? Auditions for the Blacklist?

@drdoubleyew damn dude! That's gross!

@drdoubleyew Nicki ass? J-Lo? CoCo?

@chrismudge_ nothing or nobody?

@ekoreen best part of this game, nobody played more than DD's 28 mins.

@nmchugh85 @adnanESPN you might be right, but they've beaten 3 out of 4 times this year. They match up well with them.

@adnanESPN last four games, #Clips #Spurs #Wiz &amp; #Hawks. They can hang with the best when they defend.

@Eric__Smith #Refs! forget the 4th qtr, those two clear path calls were a potential 8-10 point swing. Terrible

@Lrning2Fly epic bullshit! I have to vent on Twitter because @Jessica_Jorden makes fun of me when I yell and scream at the tv!

@Baseball_Jenn Refs tried real hard to make sure Portland won this game. Congrats to them on their effort.

Great fight from the @Raptors! Hard to win when the @trailblazers have an 8 on 5 power play the entire 4th and overtime! #RTZ

Portland played the 4th and overtime with an 8 on 5 advantage. Thanks @NBA refs! Check the bank accounts of the crew working tonight..

@WolstatSun the entire 4th quarter and this overtime has been a joke.

Refs just handed Portland this game, plain and simple. Thanks @NBA, your replays are really working! #Raps #Blazers

@Eric__Smith brutal call man, if the one on Tross wasn't, how was that?? Joke! Complete joke!

Plus T-Ross was ahead in the middle of the floor! Complete joke! @LeoRautins

That is fucking bullshit!! Exact same play not called clear path! What a joke! @LeoRautins

@LeoRautins I understand that. It's still frustrating when they create a 5-0 run for them for nothing tho.

Some big time questionable calls this whole quarter! #Raps haven't gotten one call and #Blazers have got at least 4. @LeoRautins

@stackmack this is giving me heartburn

@WinterLions he's always been awesome! Back when he was a sideline radio reporter for the Jays he was great.

Hey @NBA, you guys awake? Is there a # I can call to complain about your league pass? That'd be great!

@NBA league pass has blacked out my @Raptors so I can't watch on my phone. At least I have @Paul__Jones and Jack on Sirius.

Hey @NBA how do you justify charging $170.00 for league pass and then blacking out games so they can't be watched on mobile devices?

@NBA @NBAcom you just retweeted somebody 3 minutes ago, I know you see my tweets! Some major league bullshit!

@NBA @NBAcom unfortunately it seems that you can't.

@NBA @NBAcom I paid my money to be able to watch wherever whenever on whatever I want. Just like your commercials claim I can.

@NBA @NBAcom major disappointment. MLB doesn't blackout their mobile streaming service. There's no reason you should either.

@NBA @NBAcom I'm going to keep tweeting you until you acknowledge me or block me.

The whole point of a service like league pass on multiple platforms is so you can watch games when you're not at home, No? @NBA @NBAcom

@NBA @NBAcom your service is a joke!

@NBA @NBAcom this is a huge ripoff. If I had access to a tv I would watch it on tv. I bought league pass because I don't!

@NBA @NBAcom what's the point of this service if I can't use it?

Hey @NBA @NBAcom I purchased league pass so I could watch games at work on my phone. $170.00. Now it's blacked out??!! Wth?

@LeoRautins @Raptors @nyknicks makes sense against Melo for sure

@LeoRautins Bruno Bruno Bruno Bruno.. I just thought I'd get a jump on everybody.

@Baseball_Jenn passed concussion test. 8 stitches, will be fine

@drdoubleyew that would be their intent for sure. Most anybody that can play SS can.

@drdoubleyew Ya if they work out a deal then they pay the posting fee to his Korean club. If they don't he goes back.

@drdoubleyew rumor has it they won the bid, if that's true they still have to negotiate a contract.

@Hoodlum0404 he's not as pretty as Kyle, herky jerky, awkward looking.. That's just him tho.

@Hoodlum0404 he really is tho! Haha he's a great passer, he avg almost 10 assists/game as a starter a few years ago.

@Hoodlum0404 yes he is

@Hoodlum0404 it's only temporary anyway.. I understand what you're saying but I'm ok with how it is.

@Hoodlum0404 fields is an excellent defender and a smart player. They did this so they didn't break up the 2nd unit

@Hoodlum0404 he'll never be a good defender. You kinda take what you get with him.. He plays big when it counts tho

@Hoodlum0404 maybe next year, they're keeping him with them this year to learn English and learn their system

@Hoodlum0404 deff not a bad thing. Ride the bench for a couple years and ease him into action

@Hoodlum0404 he is, but not as much as people think. He's got a pretty smooth jump shot already.

@Hoodlum0404 he's one long armed lanky dude that for sure!

@TimBontemps where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?

@Hoodlum0404 I dunno him or Bebe

@Hoodlum0404 Raps will impose their will on this game and we might even see Brunooooo! #blowout 35 or less for Detroit in the 2nd half

@Hoodlum0404 gotta take care of the defensive boards for sure, turnovers are right up there too for me..

@Hoodlum0404 haha if any of them do he should!!

@Hoodlum0404 100% agree.. I hope they know that too! Still a young team tho, learning to be consistent..

@Hoodlum0404 most deff

@Hoodlum0404 It's a dangerous  game to play tho!

@Hoodlum0404 I agree. The problem is that they know they can lock in when they need to and most of the time they cruise and then win in 1qtr

@LeoRautins #Raps playing down to their competition.. I imagine Casey will have a few bleepable words at the half

@RattoCSN not quite as round..

@pdpatt I wanna see what the jerseys look like before I decide

@tylerspitzer1 also ban that mother fucker from all airports in Canada 4 life! Walk bitch!

@MikeCormack this isn't even the final color scheme and we have no idea what the unis will look like. People need to relax

@WolstatSun also, like always, people jump to conclusions before they've seen the final product. Chill folks

@james_in_to can we give them Esmil Rogers?

@WolstatSun silver ball?

@DrewGROF Olney is an idiot

@ekoreen if the ball is silver that'd be dope! Black and silver like the #WeTheNorth gear is fine by me!

@hotelsdotcom sending push notifications now? I know where the app is if I want to book a hotel. You don't need to remind me you're there.

@MarkBradleyAJC @Buster_ESPN signing a guy for four years with a broken neck doesn't quite jive.

@jonahkeri that only works because they don't play the #Jays next year who will also go 162-0.

@bomani_jones @johnsonray84 you can't go into a new stadium with a good team. It's a rule

@BKennedyStar when are they announcing the acquisition of Cueto Chapman &amp; Votto? Oh look, a unicorn!

@james_in_to @DrewGROF I'm holding out for Cueto, Chapman, &amp; Votto. That's happening right?

@DrewGROF 4 realz?

@Ken_Rosenthal Scherzer next for Padres?

@james_in_to they're getting rather offensive

@jcrasnick if Taylor Swift is in a stable relationship she'll stop writing music. Let's hope both happen.

@AndrewStoeten baseballs everyday on tsn &amp; sportsnet.!? üôâ

@VernonWells10 @NBA that's a pretty filthy lineup they've got there VDub! Lobs all day

@AndrewStoeten I'd just feel a lot better with a stud at the back end of the bullpen.

@AndrewStoeten reading this list makes me wish they swallowed hard and signed Miller or Robertson.

@LeoRautins @dallasmavs @NBA @celtics they're gonna be lethal. He's gonna have 40 assists per night!

@ekoreen he could average 20 assists/game with them tho..

@BKennedyStar great song! By far my favorite Xmas tune!

@BKennedyStar @enosarris based on this chart the DBacks could deff use Navarro.. Maybe something could actually be done there.

@jonahkeri @ekoreen is Rihanna responsible for any of this?

@THEKIDMERO @nyknicks you think you could turn that shit show around? Run an obtuse triangle offense?

@ekoreen could refer to them as Big Johnson &amp; Lil Johnson. Old Johnson &amp; Young Johnson. Neck Tat Johnson &amp; No Neck Tat Johnson.

@Eric__Smith @LeoRautins @24BlackGoldBlue @tim_micallef on that note, are you predictin black &amp; gold for the rebrand? Am I OVO'er analyzing?

@TorrensJonathan @SonyPictures without a doubt!

Why does @SonyPictures give a shit what North Korea does or thinks?

@LeoRautins @Raptors nice!

@LeoRautins @Raptors throwbacks tonight?

@haralabob not soon enough you mean!

@haralabob holy Balls! ATL is loving life right now!

@haralabob it would be so amazeballs if New York Denver were 1-2 in 2016! For Toronto I mean

@drdoubleyew you said "I get you". Like a prize right? You're mine?

@drdoubleyew I read the sarcasm LOUD &amp; clear mon ami.

@drdoubleyew coaching is always overplayed. Positive or negative. I do believe some guys are great motivators and communicators tho!

@AndrewStoeten Ugh. Fine Andrew. Let's not assume anything, let's have a wonderful fact based day. üëé

@AndrewStoeten haha fucker. He will never blatantly say anything about it. We both know THAT.

@AndrewStoeten sounded that way to me. We've got our limits etc.

@AndrewStoeten no what?

@AndrewStoeten nothing we didn't know but safe to say he's deff got a hard number he can't exceed.

@haralabob not after that start. He's like fuck it.

@LeoRautins Ya sorry, I meant in a trade this season

@LeoRautins seeing as tho Amir is a FA, do you think Greg Monroe is worth taking a look at?

@drdoubleyew can you donate so that they have to keep or burn the shirt?

@drdoubleyew I totally get that bro.. I do. But they still fill that place.. It's amazing kinda.

@LeoRautins when the @Raptors put their mind to it and their bigs hedge hard on picks, they're a dominant defensive team!

@drdoubleyew @tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 well now you're talking. Hall &amp; 4 future 1st rounders should get that done! ;)

@drdoubleyew @tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 who's that guy?? I'm drawing a blank

@tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 @drdoubleyew when they get McDavid tho...

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin @drdoubleyew anything but that. I think you'd have a hard time getting anything close to his worth

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin @drdoubleyew being an Oilers fan makes you!

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin @drdoubleyew as an outsider, the fact you guys are discussing trading Hall, shows how batshit crazy

@adnanESPN 29 or 30. I for every million

@Jackie_Redmond by tiny do you mean all of him?

@TravisDakin hence their desire to have MacT fly it.

@LeoRautins @Raptors @SacramentoKings they were 8-4 before their best player got sick. Not sure how that goes unnoticed

@BillSimmons boogie for JV and Landry Fields. Make it so Masai

@TimBontemps dumbest thing to happen this season so far. Great young coach

@LeoRautins ugly game to be honest. This ain't gymnastics tho, style don't matter! Just win!

@Eric__Smith 9-0 in ft's too.

@AndrewStoeten seems odd buy chicago is a pretty sweet city! Can't blame him for wanting to be there.

@DrewGROF as in, "we need relief pitching"?

@AndrewStoeten missing is that Martin potentially makes 12 people on the roster better! If that means giving up Melky, I'm all for it!

@AndrewStoeten I'm perfectly ok with swapping Lawrie, Lind, &amp; Melky for Donaldson, Martin, &amp; Saunders in the lineup. I think what people are

@james_in_to Jays didn't wait

@james_in_to what FA in their right mind will say "I hate it here, I'm so glad that contract is done!"? He held out for more, didn't get it.

@james_in_to you're prob close, I was gonna say 45

@Baseball_Jenn disappointing as a #Jays fan. I hope they still have some cash to play with to upgrade a lil more! Still like our lineup tho

@bomani_jones @nta71 "most" people don't even know what it is!

@TimBontemps lulling them into a false sense of security. For the whole season. It's a five year strategy

@drdoubleyew noted

@drdoubleyew down with Webster???

@drdoubleyew it's pretty dope!

Hey @drdoubleyew, have you listened to the new @WuTangClan yet?

@drdoubleyew oh no that's gotta be legit emergency! Send your credit card info immediately!

@drdoubleyew yessir!

@drdoubleyew too legit to quit

@AnthaV it's still early! Lots of time for it to still be great! Happy Birthday!

@AndrewStoeten not worth your time.

@AndrewStoeten @Fibnation @Baseball_Jenn also, with his stuff, he will always find some team willing to give him a chance to start.

@haralabob he was getting all pissy at Landry Fields and JJ the other night too. Pulls back and looks up the court

@tylerspitzer1 @drdoubleyew I dig it! Jordan makes some sweet swag!

@Sid_Seixeiro @FadooBobcat the issue is Amir is playing on two broken legs and he's their best defender. That's where it starts and ends

@AndrewStoeten ummm what?

@james_in_to he shouldn't! One bomb and that shit will be soaring again!

@RGriffinStar Crazy! Us Jays fans just sit and fantasize..

@RGriffinStar with the way it's going not unreasonable to think Shields get 18-19 &amp; Scherzer gets 30/year?

Based on current market, prob safe to assume Shields gets 17-19/year? @AndrewStoeten

@AndrewStoeten hahaha I knew you would feel that way!

@AndrewStoeten he very well could. He's fallin out of favor in Miami I read earlier.. They know a little somethin about young pitching.

@AndrewStoeten I know, in light of payroll crap I say trade dickey and put Norris in the rotation. Roll the dice with Buerhle and 4 youngins

@AndrewStoeten Ya I suppose.. I like to think Norris is gonna pan out quite nicely!

@AndrewStoeten either way, Jays can't afford it. :(

@AndrewStoeten Heaney = Norris?

@AndrewStoeten this is all depressing as fuck and I hope it's way wrong and he just dumps another 25 mil into the payroll to show us.

@AndrewStoeten Jays went from very much in on Lester accord to PTS &amp; Bob, &amp; now have 5 mil or less to spend?? What gives? #BIRDSALLDAY

@james_in_to dislike in a major way! Stern warning and possible backhand if it ever happens again!

@AndrewStoeten that's exactly the same amount of ideas I have.

@AndrewStoeten since you're in the mood, what do suppose Casey Janssen's price is?

@AndrewStoeten I forgot about Reed! I'd take him..

@AndrewStoeten meh. I ain't scurred..

@THEKIDMERO unintentionally tanking doesn't count as tanking.

@james_in_to I know all that I just think if they were that strapped they would've attacked the bullpen first. That's just my opinion

@james_in_to that would make their approach this offseason very odd considering their major weaknesses, no?

@AndrewStoeten @Sandsy02 if he's cheap what do you have to lose? Minimal risk, potential for a some reward? Go for it.

@james_in_to throw in EE &amp; take back Votto and his enormous contract.

@james_in_to orrrr Osuna, Norris, Castro &amp; Pentacost for Cueto &amp; Chapman.

@james_in_to if we're making shit up, sign Shields, trade RA &amp; Thole along with Osuna &amp; ?? For Gordon &amp; Jansen

@JoshTheBress @JeffPassan Jon Lester wants David Ross.

@AndrewStoeten amen to all that and not watching him carve up the Jays 4 or 5 times a year won't hurt my feelings either!

@drdoubleyew @tylerspitzer1 it's never over friends! I'll save you seats in my suite!

@tylerspitzer1 @drdoubleyew who are you again?

@drdoubleyew fame. It was only a matter of time

@AndrewStoeten aww fame! It's beautiful! It's my big break! ;)

@LeoRautins @Raptors 48 mins! Full 48!

Hey @TSN_Sports, I'm really starting to hate this Lebron Nike commercial. Sincerely, Everyone. #RTZ #WeTheNorth #WereNotCleveland

@AndrewStoeten what's not?

@AndrewStoeten do the Jays have the equivalent of the Halladay return in their system to give Philly for Hamels? Serious question.

@bnicholsonsmith just ok? Like if somebody asked you how the tacos were you'd say "ok"? Or pretty Damn good tacos? This is important.

@AndrewStoeten Gibby just said on MLB radio that they're not out on Melky. Take that for what it's worth..

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 exactly.

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 he's almost 70. I think it's fair to assume he may want some time off.

@tylerspitzer1 @Hoodlum0404 @simmonssteve supposed to look for anybody else?? I'm not buying all this butthurt bullshit.

@tylerspitzer1 @Hoodlum0404 @simmonssteve it was expected that this was Beeston's last year anyway and he was going to retire! Are they not

@james_in_to no thanks.

@AndrewStoeten I think it'd be a fair deal, 12 years of control plus a big bat for two FA's too be and eating Votto's deal.

Late night thoughts. Norris, Sanchez, EE for Cueto, Chapman, &amp; Votto. Do you @AndrewStoeten?

@bluebirdbanter I'm holding out hope the rest of the FA pitchers end up outside of AL east unless it's in Toronto! NL preferably

@chrisrock is the funniest dude on the planet. Hands down. Killin' it on @jimmyfallon! #TopFiveMovie

@HumandChuck woulda been nice if AA coulda worked him into the Donaldson deal!

Jack's new line "Whaaaapppp!!" Is awesome! @LeoRautins @Matt__Devlin

@ekoreen cue the world reminding you of his earlier dunk

@LeoRautins I said "would"...

This would Raps worst loss of season easily. Completely quit playing D, fell asleep. @LeoRautins

@haralabob assuming Thibs doesn't kill him this year, would you chase Butler this offseason if you were the Raptors? Seems like a great fit

@AndrewStoeten not necessarily him over Norris, I just like the Strochez bromance. #416

@AndrewStoeten I'd trade anyone other than Stroman, Sanchez, &amp; Hutchison to get Holland.

@AnthaV hah, it's really real. I'm chugging koolaid as fast as I can pour it!

@AnthaV it didn't come from nowhere.. I actually believe it

@AndrewStoeten done my good man! My social feeds are now full of your beautiful mug!

@LeoRautins the #Bulls foul on every play. All of them. It's crazy actually!

@haralabob what's up with that?

@iainsut the ability to spell his name correctly?

@james_in_to don't you think if this were true, AA wouldn't be shelling out 82 mil for a new catcher and saying he has money to spend?

@bruce_arthur consistent effort from JV would help a lot. Consistent effort from Ross would help a lot. It's a theme

@LeoRautins I'm greedy! Haha

@LeoRautins usually. These are the games I want to see them win more than any other. Lebron is the best but I want to see him lose!! :)

@LeoRautins sucks when the entire supporting cast goes ice cold on the same night. Somebody needs to step up!

@Raptors are struggling big time. Need somebody to give them something. Anything. Hello Lou? Ross? Patterson? You guys wanna show up?

@AndrewStoeten my only question, is that projected profit losses? Or actual losses?

@AndrewStoeten ah I missed that. Saunders at 6.5 doesn't seem quite as good somehow.

@AndrewStoeten did you see this? http://t.co/JaTTBtDOSC

@AnthaV true. I'd say those two are a safe bet to be here tho.. I'm hoping I might be able to get a Lester jersey.. #Imadreamer

@AnthaV 2 outta 3 ain't bad! ;) who's next? Russ Martin? Josh Donaldson?

@timandsid a footprint is one damn footprint! Not a pair.

@AnthaV who are all the past ones? Brett? Colby? Morrow?

@Baseball_Jenn may as well be tofu

@THEKIDMERO looked like a legit Melo move to me..

@LeoRautins if the Cavs play like this tomorrow, we're gonna see Bruno, Fields, &amp; Stietsma! #blowout

@michaelgrange maybe, it's real tho!

@DallasLatos cooking is sexy as hell! I can be 40 levels of cranky and good food eliminates that pronto

@THEKIDMERO this game has been ugly huh? Lebron looks like he's seriously regretting this shit!

@haralabob he usually kills it in the garden..

@DaltonPompey in the interest of our economy I hope it never does! Gotta go back up!

@LeoRautins in the interest of the @Raptors I hope this is a dogfight and Lebron &amp; company play 44+ minutes! Haha

@LeoRautins  both these teams have some stretches of really ugly offense. Waiters, JR Smith.... Yikes

@Hoodlum0404 just confirming. Hah

@haralabob so on the 100 scale he's a 10?

@Hoodlum0404 you hate Dany Heatley too?

@haralabob both of these teams have a few ball stoppers. It's hard to watch sometimes, lots of contested looks with no ball movement.

@bomani_jones they better hope Lebron &amp; Melo go off for 75 each so everybody sorta forgets about that shit

@bomani_jones @BenAxelrod he watched a video so that makes sense tho

@Hoodlum0404 @drdoubleyew @TravisDakin @rcb38 you nailed it. It's sad. Period. It's 2014 and we haven't evolved past this shit.

@james_in_to his &amp; pandas contracts and then looking at Donaldson for 4.5?! AA has made some pretty savvy moves!

@james_in_to he did it in college right?

@Klow7 just killin' it! Big time! @Raptors @greivisvasquez @pdpatt @JValanciunas @IamAmirJohnson keep it Rollin! #RTZ #WeTheNorth

@LeoRautins this team is sick! What else can you say.. Unreal! #RTZ #WeTheNorth

@Eric__Smith @FAN590 shock to nobody. This dude is ridiculous for the beating he takes!

@AndrewStoeten what do classify as big? Shields Lester Sherzer big? Or McCarthy Liriano big?

@james_in_to I would have a bonor from now til spring training if that happened!

@dustinparkes not even.. Happ was going to make more than Saunders no?

@bnicholsonsmith or create opportunity to sign a FA pitcher? And then trade dickey and Thole? And Navarro? And build a bullpen? And a bench?

@gregorMLB I like this! AA being savvy again

@conradforbis I think they've always had the best intentions. They're just fucking dumb! Can't fix dumb.

@AndrewStoeten any of Ogando, Beachy or Medlen worth a gamble?

@AndrewStoeten I'd prefer if that wasn't the case. They could do worse at DH I suppose tho.

@AndrewStoeten @Joelsherman1 where there's Smoak there's fire. #Illseemyselfout

@AndrewStoeten I'm little surprised Smoak. I thought they'd keep him for sure.

@LeoRautins @Eric__Smith just to keep you guys in the loop, I like this quarter much better!! JJ is beastin!

I realize they're winning, but I don't like that quarter. Way too easy for the Kings. @LeoRautins @Eric__Smith

I'm having flashbacks to last season here.. Hot start, relax, dogfight. @LeoRautins @Eric__Smith

@Eric__Smith Raps have quit playing D and ball movement has went out the window.

Love that quarter, but TRoss has got to take that last shot! @LeoRautins

Great timeout. Defense has taken the last 4 possessions off! @LeoRautins

@keithlaw do you think this opinion was created? Or did it evolve? #SeeWhatIDidThere

@AndrewStoeten Derek Lowe proved it can work. I'd rather have him in the bullpen if he can't be in the big league rotation. He can go back.

@AndrewStoeten would you send him to AAA instead?

@AndrewStoeten this playoffs proved the value of dominant relief pitching. If Jays have a full rotation I fully support him being in pen.

@LeoRautins I meant won

This is a game they should have fun. Too little too late IMO. @LeoRautins

@Sportsnet so with 1:30 left in this game your suddenly going to shit on me? #cmonman

@stackmack much much better quarter. One more like that.

This has been an ugly ugly @Raptors game so far! Finish this one strong! #RTZ

@JonHeymanCBS they don't "need" a washed up attitude problem! They need a closer!

@LeoRautins Lakers are on fire, Raptors have looked like crap, only stuck 6? I'll take it

@Ryan_McCrystal @BMcCarthy32 sooo don't pound ass, just pound your wife in the face? Got it.

@mlbtrbluejays @BKennedyStar by considering they mean, that guy? Naw.

@LeoRautins @Raptors I completely agree. If he did it consistently it would take his game to a whole other level.

@LeoRautins @Raptors to be fair, Terrence rarely attacks anybody.

@stackmack how else will people know how cool you are and that you have somebody that's willing to talk to you??

@Eric__Smith nows the time for T-Ross to step up! Take advantage of extra minutes.

@RGriffinStar *tips cap*

@TorontoStar @RGriffinStar "WAR to die for" I see what you did there Griff

@ekoreen James Johnson, he would disrupt the second unit the least. Or fields.

RT @jcrasnick: Highest WAR for position players over past 2 seasons: Trout 16.7; Donaldson 15.4; McCutchen 14.4; Cano 13.9.

Great battle by the @Raptors tonight. No quit, just didn't have it tonight. On to the next! Be ok DD!! #RTZ

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin he's got plenty. Everything I read is telling me he's got 30-40 more mil to spend on next years payroll

@TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 I'll take my chances with Pompey in center

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin I want better. There are better options out there that won't break the bank. Jed Lowrie, Asdrubal Cabrera etc

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin hopefully none of the above!

@TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 easy cowboy. One day at a time! ;)

@Hoodlum0404 Ya I meant all around best 3B, bat &amp; glove. Very valuable

@TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 they gave up a ton to acquire pitchers last year, didn't work, need to restock.

@Hoodlum0404 arguably the best 3B in the game the last two seasons. Huge get!

@james_in_to think bigger.. EE? JoeyBats?

@LeoRautins borderline amazing considering how they looked. Bodes well if they get it going to start the second half

The thing bugging me the most about this game.. Missed FT's! @LeoRautins

@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten I hate you both right now. That is all

@DaltonPompey @Raptors game man!

RT @AndrewStoeten: Whuuuuuuuuuuuuut? RT @LottOnBaseball: The rigging of a grand jury ‚Ä¶ RT @HumandChuck: Well, this is awkward http://t.co/3‚Ä¶

Pretty decent performance by the @EdmontonOilers there.. Made it competitive but didn't do anything to screw up the quest for McDavid

@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky I have no idea if this is going to work for you at all. They may just like Andrew more than you.

@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky I may have shed a tear there.. I think I did.. Maybe it's because -22.. Yup it's frozen

@AndrewStoeten hmm no thanks

@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky touch√©. Windsor Ontario is what I was looking for but earth works.

@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky dirk you gotta answer some trivia first. Where is Wisers brewery located?

@TimBontemps I'd say the @Raptors are having a pretty good time.

@michaelgrange the big diff from last year to this is at least 4-5 games they've won the wouldn't have last year.

@TimBontemps told him he needed to get laid so he wasn't so damn cranky all the time?

@LeoRautins if G gets Rollin the starting 5 will only need to play 24 mins a night!

@Chris_Toutant I like the Jed Lowrie idea. Also, Brandon McCarthy, Justin Masterson, Asdrubal Cabrera

Who's one unmentioned name you'd try to acquire if you were AA? Any position. @AndrewStoeten

@drdoubleyew oh but Dave, Christy put herself in that situation! Unlike Wilson who wasn't looking for troub.. Oh nevermind

@supermatt1331 @LottOnBaseball were you there "Super"Matt? Flew over there to have a look?

@TheePharoah avoid walking places??

@AndrewStoeten if they said you want this guy, your taking him too.

@AndrewStoeten I was asking if he was worth a gamble if he came with those guys

@AndrewStoeten to get a LFer?

@AndrewStoeten if he's part of a package including Latos or Cueto?

@LeoRautins pretty physical game so far with few calls. Both ways tho

@ekoreen justifiably so

@LeoRautins curious why T-Ross doesn't attack the basket more at the start of games? See a few go in before jacking up jumpers

@baseballexis I get your point. Not everybody is comfortable with that component tho. His actual job is to run the football.

@baseballexis they just fined him $100,000 for not talking. They're lucky they got that much! Kind of a bs fine IMO

@AndrewStoeten @DrewGROF poor old Jerry thought you guys were friends Andrew! "Ya notice how I didn't say Stoeten?" "Reason for that!"

@DrewGROF is it because he smells of garlic? I feel like he smells like garlic &amp; brut.

@LeoRautins haha this makes way too much sense! I think that's your problem Leo, all rational and reasonable.

@AndrewStoeten everytime I read about Boston or New York doing anything I experience equal parts of envy &amp; sadness.. Maybe not equal.

@Baseball_Jenn your move Alex! (Please be Lester, please be Lester üôè)

@Chris_Toman easily! I thought 6/120 min. If Panda would take same deal from Toronto I'd give it to him.. 5/90.

@Chris_Toman think this lowers Panda's deal? Seems low to me

@DrewGROF gotcha! I personally value sick skills.. Hanley has them shits

@DrewGROF elaborate on "culture" please.

@AndrewStoeten in reference to your earlier convo, wouldn't you rather sign Lester instead of Melky? Take your chances get an OF in trade 4

@Baseball_Jenn @InItToWinnik @AndrewStoeten @cdsmitty I actually don't have a problem with that tantrum. Desire to play is ok with me

@AndrewStoeten not the first time I've heard this.. I wonder who the problem children are/were?

@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten @jefflewis21 @BennisSnet you guys think maybe Gibbons is a little too hands off?

@Hoodlum0404 we agree again.. Twice in two days.. This is a disturbing trend

@Eric__Smith @Raptors great Effin game! Lou is our Vinnie Johnson!

@Hoodlum0404 whoa! Are you drunk?? ;)

@Hoodlum0404 for sure! That'll come with time, still a young group! That's what's so awesome about them.

@Hoodlum0404 fuck Ya man! Down by 24 in the 1st quarter and just poured it on! Not like these are the 76ers either!

@LeoRautins this team man.. Wow! Take their best punch, get up, and beat them down! Unreal

@LeoRautins @Raptors now just gotta get this #Cavs team back to their selfish inefficient ways and we're golden!

@LeoRautins get this thing to single digits by halftime and play @Raptors balls in the second half! All good

@keithlaw just favorited some shit! He's not locked up anywhere.. Or maybe he is and @adnanESPN is running his account..

@JeffPassan umm asset may be pushing it, no?

@AndrewStoeten is Curt suspended? Otherwise that theory holds no water

@AndrewStoeten Bob is still whipping this Lester horse... Man do I ever hope he's right!

@RGriffinStar @Baseball_Jenn fwiw I've never had trouble finding leaves in Toronto.. Trees if you will..

@AndrewStoeten you think Jay Bruce would be a good fit in Churrono?

@AndrewStoeten @CrawfordChrisV it makes me crazy when people say Toe Ron Toe

@AndrewStoeten @russellmartin55 I thought it was pronounced "The 6"?

@chrismudge_ in Superbad or Jumpstreet?

@AndrewStoeten it was a good fantasy.. I'll believe this to be true until it's not.

Big win for the @Raptors tonight! #RTZ #WeTheNorth #WeTheFourth

@james_in_to need room on the 40 man for Lester &amp; Miller. Right? Right?!

@bnicholsonsmith @alexspeier oh that's the final straw! Now they're signing Lester for sure! And Miller! AA must be soooo mad.. üòè

@AndrewStoeten I like this very much! I was watching PTS when he said that this afternoon and I got a bit of a chub...

@AndrewStoeten whattya make of your last RT? You feel there's truth to that?

@AnthaV @russellmartin55 they're gonna wait until Lester is in his too so they can do it together..... I hope.. Very much.

@AndrewStoeten @Wilnerness590 shameless self promotion.. I dig it!

@russellmartin55 is a @BlueJays! That's pretty badass! #Jays

Just watched season 6 of Californication and fell madly in love with @MaggieGrace! Hank Moody you moron!

@SNCaroline what the fuck did I just read? Am I high?

@baseballexis if possible I wager they trade dickey and Thole. Problemo solved

@BillSimmons you think they don't?

@AnthaV I would like to see three things. Melky, a high quality infielder, and some bullpen... And Scherzer. And Lester. I know that's not 3

@bruce_arthur so in other words, anything he wants to escape.

@ekoreen hahaha I don't care brah! Just bustin your balls

@ekoreen camera-person.. It was a WO-man

@LeoRautins 0 FT's so far..

Tough loss for the @Raptors. Lost this game in the third quarter. On to the next. #RTZ

@LeoRautins that foul hurt... Could be the back breaker

@LeoRautins @Raptors haha why do you have to be so logical?? ;)

@ekoreen that was some epic Noah bullshit! You know this man!

@Hoodlum0404 me too

@Hoodlum0404 they're 7-1.. Also, the Bulls are fucking good! Really fucking good! Sometimes you need a game like this..

@Eric__Smith they have been outplayed but the #Raps are getting a raw deal on a couple of these foul/non-foul calls

@ekoreen some "reputation" bullshit

@timpchisholm break his arm and/or leg?

@tylerspitzer1 @TravisDakin there's only one game on... ;)

@TravisDakin you're on your own

@TravisDakin what game are we talking about? Haha

@TravisDakin it's on tsn2 &amp; 4

My daughter watching @KateBeirness &amp; the @SportsCentre  loop. She wakes me up for it every damn morning! http://t.co/Hen4tuE30K

@james_in_to hahaha well played sir!

@michaelgrange but Harden is a great.. Uhh good.. Errr satisfactory.. Hmm subpar.. Ugh terrible defender! But that jabstep tho!

@TimBontemps very Knicks-esque

@IB_BlueJays @keithlaw just because he's their #1, doesn't make him a prospect.

@jonmorosi that sounds serious/painful

@Ken_Rosenthal @jcrasnick your funny.. #SeeWhatIDidThere

@THEKIDMERO that guy is a pain in the ass.. Probably literally for someone

Watching @FadooBobcat on #PTS. http://t.co/gW0tIlSszp

@bnicholsonsmith let's not kid ourselves, the Jays aren't signing anyone of significance. I'd love to be wrong about this. But I won't be

@theScoreHelp you're right! It worked, thanks

@theScore what the heck did you guys do to the app? #itsnotbetter

So the Thursday game, is that a TNT game? Will we see that broadcast or no? @LeoRautins @Matt__Devlin

@LeoRautins so that fourth quarter huh?? Wow! Sweet Lou and PattyPat!

@LeoRautins @Raptors Orlando is playing great, Raps are flat. Not a good formula.

Congrats @AndrewStoeten!

@drdoubleyew he's from fucking Weyburn.. I'm impressed he can talk!

@AndrewStoeten bout the same chance the #Raps acquire Kobe for Landry Fields.. Actually, that's more likely

@LeoRautins dude deserves a ton of credit! Never hear any complaints and he barely plays. Tough spot

@LeoRautins Landry has got to see the floor at some point here eh?

@drdoubleyew wouldn't you? Haha

@meghanmarkle I just powered through seasons 1-4ep10 of @Suits_USA in the last two weeks! That last one was INTENSE! #hooked

@drdoubleyew a saggy old one or a perky supple one?

@drdoubleyew @TravisDakin my point exactly!!

@TravisDakin just think of the 100 or so loads you'll need to blow once you do heal! 100 BJ's is in order.. IMO

@LeoRautins there it is! Haha

@LeoRautins not exactly what I had in mind with the throat stomping.. Also, somebody needs to tell Lou to stop thinking and just shoot

@LeoRautins if they don't come out to start the third and stomp on their neck, there's a big problem!

@ekoreen JJ is still a ball stopper I see.. Pass the ball dude! Pass the damn ball!

@LeoRautins @Raptors I'm saying if anybody could.. It'd be them!

@LeoRautins @Raptors these aren't the MJ Bulls! They haven't earned the right to ease into games.. Not even close

@TonyRasmusIV What can Dickey get them? Besides freeing up dead weight in Thole

@LeoRautins I believe in miracles..

@LeoRautins big part of it for sure! Outplayed for most of this game tho.. On to the next..

@Raptors are doing a lot of bitching to the zebras but they only have themselves to blame for this one. @LeoRautins

@AndrewStoeten it is hard to believe.. That being said, they weren't a Lind away from the playoffs anyway.

@TravisDakin to say the least.. I read a great shirt the other day, "I don't even like the people I like!"

@TravisDakin I haven't but that's what I'm getting at. Rape/assault fantasy isn't quite as great when it's really happening..

@TravisDakin fantasy vs reality.

@LeoRautins @shermanhamilton deff save it!

@TravisDakin this is your most accurate tweet ever. I didn't even have to read the rest to know that.

@bomani_jones thoughts??  http://t.co/cLetJYEf95

@bomani_jones thoughts on this?

@ScottMillerBbl does Joe Maddon win more games than John Gibbons with same team?

@ekoreen @Sportsnet @ShiDavidi if it coincides with a payroll hike and more winning nobody will care.

@AndrewStoeten @Bluejayburger payroll spiking?? Pleaaaassseee

Welcome back Mitchell! Sick pass! #Avs @Avalanche

@drdoubleyew @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 bahaha hahahahhahaha at least you haven't lost your sense of humor! Sanity maybe, but not humor

@drdoubleyew @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 that's not a very good way to start negotiations! Ok ok, Stuart too.

@drdoubleyew @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 trade Ya briere and iginla straight up for em.

@tylerspitzer1 one step closer to McDavid

@DrewGROF gross

@drdoubleyew meh. They'll play good enough to avoid that bro. We both know this haha

@drdoubleyew at least I have the #Raps to distract me. That's my strategy. Also, being Superbad could prove rather lucrative this year..

@drdoubleyew seems doable..

@drdoubleyew since you've watched a decade long tire fire, what are some of the things I should know?

RT @edgeloading: Best thing I'll see all day. http://t.co/29M6lUQQ6C

@TravisDakin how many Dmen can you get if you trade away all of your future draft picks?

@AndrewStoeten @WongSN590 @outsidethenba naw, in two years there'll be some other 6' 9" guy in that small forward spot.. My fav snack! KD

@AndrewStoeten some buggy eyed useless twat who nobody takes seriously? Oh, he did that for himself already? Mission accomplished

I'm firmly planted on the @Royals bandwagon! Dominated two very good teams to get here, bullpen is lights out! 6 inning game.

@tylerspitzer1 great day for that! Also golf... I'm wasting it at my job..

@tylerspitzer1 there's rocks in your tv room?

@tylerspitzer1 Cox is by far the worst part of this. His huge eyeballs in HD..

@tylerspitzer1 even if you don't feel like it, whine as much as possible! We men have an image to uphold!

@RealSports are you guys gonna have the @Raptors throwbacks for sale at some point?

‚Äú@YourAnonNews: #Ebola ~ Ambulances surround flight from NYC at McCarran http://t.co/GshJiQmC9O‚Äù &lt;---what the sweet Jesus fuck?!

@drunkjaysfans @AndrewStoeten I allow myself this dumb offseason fantasy every year that the payroll will go up to 170mil or so! #HelloMax

@DallasLatos right?!?

@drdoubleyew cray!

@drdoubleyew I believe it

@drdoubleyew those coveralls look crisppp!

@Wilnerness590 @AndrewStoeten @MattGelb what??! This is the worst possible news! Springtraining will never be the same! Pastry baskets üòû

@CJNitkowski @Ken_Rosenthal I'd buy that he meant to throw at him, just not that close to his head. I doubt he wanted to hit him in the face

@bomani_jones meh. Way overblown. It's a funny internet meme. College kids get that shit.

@TheGarfoose @SNBarryDavis good point!

@TheGarfoose @SNBarryDavis in elevators or with sticks?

@TheGarfoose @SNBarryDavis you never hit anybody on purpose Dirk?

@JennyJohnsonHi5 will all the chicks have huge vag's?

@CJNitkowski umpires are never accountable it seems. They should be punted to the minors just like players for poor performance.

@tylerspitzer1 ride them down the aisle like a pony

@tylerspitzer1 @GlobalEdmonton Air Canada might lose your shit but at least it's fuckin free!

@TravisDakin @Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 @bejarv @tincup_21 @Corydakin 90 wins......

@drdoubleyew I hear ya sister!

@drdoubleyew yes, I know the one. #longhairdontcare

@drdoubleyew are you referring to whom I think you're referring? It's better than collecting babies! I'm related to a baby collector!

How the hell has Pete Rose not been given a second chance yet? Insanity @AndrewStoeten @SNETCampbell @bnicholsonsmith

@tylerspitzer1 @drdoubleyew give him his candy and I bet he's very generous!

@tylerspitzer1 @drdoubleyew that's aight! I wanna carry DJ's bag! There's treats in there!

@drdoubleyew @tylerspitzer1 might be a quicker rise to the top! Put some thinkin on it!

@tylerspitzer1 @drdoubleyew how much of that 10mil does the caddy get? Just in case the tour doesn't pan out...

@drdoubleyew hahaha Yeah, he strikes me as the type!

@drdoubleyew followed by the Sunday night game.

@drdoubleyew every weekend Rogers is broadcasting from a different place. Ron Maclean, Stanley Cup &amp; kids activities and whatnot.

‚Äú@hometownhockey_: Is #HometownHockey coming to a town near you? http://t.co/AdXHDgznrf‚Äù #YMM

@JamesCybulski it does remind however, that you can murder and be convicted of manslaughter.

@AndrewStoeten I didn't think so. Buck &amp; Pat were not so subtly suggesting that tonight...

Would you pay Morrow 10 mil to pitch at the back of the bullpen next year? @AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith @BKennedyStar

@RGriffinStar why hmm? Navarro and JoeyBats shoulda been right behind him! Empty the bench!

@Hoodlum0404 @tylerspitzer1 @bejarv @TravisDakin get to 90 wins first.. Then we will talk....

@bruce_arthur are they going to need the weapons they sold them back? Building new ones will probably be better for their economy.

@THEKIDMERO and who beats women on the regular

@BlueJays @JoeyBats19 with the bluejays.. Ugh this feed kills me

@Hoodlum0404 @DetroitLions could be true yup

@Hoodlum0404 @DetroitLions it wouldn't feel right without them!

@bomani_jones your government needs those neighborhoods. That's where they breed their best soldiers. 30k a year is attractive to poor ppl.

@james_in_to @BKennedyStar July 24th - 26th

@tylerspitzer1 good thing they gave him all those dollas! Maybe shoulda just been hollas! #BB16 #youknow

@james_in_to it's funny because no matter who they're playing they find a way to ball wash them. Also deep throating! Pedroia's blrghka

@james_in_to there'd be riots. Or they'd just wait and look up to make the call...

@BKennedyStar you misspelled bullshit

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 now that he's hurt maybe they can bang out an extension without it being a distraction! #please

@Hoodlum0404 @TravisDakin @tylerspitzer1 I agree with Scott. Melky stays, Colby's a goner.

@tylerspitzer1 @Lrning2Fly @Mnurse78 in your pocket I hope.. #buzzxxx

@tylerspitzer1 @Lrning2Fly @Mnurse78 where's your phone right now? #buzzxxx

@tylerspitzer1 @Lrning2Fly @Mnurse78 how bout this? #buzzxxx

@tylerspitzer1 @Lrning2Fly @Mnurse78 you like that? #buzzxxx

@Lrning2Fly @Mnurse78 @tylerspitzer1 they'll understand. "Daddy would rather be drunk than see you pretend to play hockey, ok?"

@Lrning2Fly @Mnurse78 @tylerspitzer1 not til march or something! Some epic level bullshit. This seasons schedule is shite

@Mnurse78 @Lrning2Fly @tylerspitzer1 even if you're attending an Oilers game, it's still not HD.

@AndrewStoeten true.. Very true

@peteanderson @AndrewStoeten @james_in_to FA, maybe JJ Hardy. Or Adeiny Hechavaria....

@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to ya, RF. Move Melky to RF, Reyes to LF.

@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten left field. Melky can play right. JB can play 3rd. Lawrie 2nd.

@tylerspitzer1 solid maybe! Gotta go about 18-5 or 17-6 tho.. Need 89-90 wins.

@james_in_to also, context is very important here. Obviously they're not gonna say he sucks to the media.

@gregorMLB what preceded these statements from AA &amp; Gibby? Questions regarding Valencia's status? Or they just start spewing stuff?

@jonahkeri @BMcCarthy32 @gabekapler isn't there an unwritten rule against that?

@TheeRouse @bruce_arthur you send back ‚ù§Ô∏è

@james_in_to @drunkjaysfans hahaha good catch!

@HumandChuck epic level of bullshit.

@HumandChuck Joe Maddon is annoying. It was cute for a few years. Now annoying.
