I have been told a @comcast @XFINITY customer service manager will call me back. I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one.

So not really sure which company is failing @comcast or @xfinity, either way I'm pissed and without service

It must be a customer service prank at @comcast to say "I promise this call won't disconnect" before the call in fact disconnects

@omriduek @comcast haha my favorite is when they tell me since on demand isn't a service I pay extra for it isn't really a service problem

@omriduek @comcast seriously, this is the worst company to have to deal with

Just realized its the season for the @TiffanyAndCo holiday catalog. #uhoh #byepaycheck

@NYsocialbee don't worry, you didn't miss much. Its one of the worst composed books I've ever read. I'm truly surprised it was published

@NYsocialbee are you sure you aren't watching the auditions for 50 shades of grey?

@VBluesBillyBob but it gets better the more you listen to it

RT @andygrammer: Ever try to spell a word and you are so far off spell check doesn't even have any suggestions? #youreonyourown #feelinlike‚Ä¶

@allisonmak They were! I think molly too...amrican girl calls them "retired"

@TooTightTones partayyyyy

@allisonmak I didn't recieve that much support haha

So excited to see @mattnathanson exactly 1 week from today!!

@VBluesBillyBob you knew it was true before you read it

@lindsayost I'm out in west bloomfield...so not very far, but not close enough for weekday trivia :(

@lindsayost I want trivia night!

RT @clmgiudici: How I've missed you... #RHOBH

@joewentworth I know! Miss having you brighten the mornings!

@joewentworth couldn't haha, its too small and blurry

@joewentworth haha I couldn't read the sign!

@BIGGBYmuffin do these fit the kuerig?

@VBluesBillyBob that's your body eating your muscels. I'm not kidding.

@samantha__89 I just made popcorn that way since I felt defeated, haha. But ill have to try stovetop kale!

@HannahElise_ I used kroger plus points...soo unfortunately it wasn't a general deal

@VBluesBillyBob its the same idea

@VBluesBillyBob how does that rais awareness for testicular cancer? Please refer to: http://t.co/63fXgYEe4J

@VBluesBillyBob no. You know how I feel about that. Just no.

@samantha__89 I just don't understand how it became such an event for men

@RecreAlison kittens grow out of it, I promise!

@samantha__89 the limit does not exist! #meangirls #Halloween #hadto

@VBluesBillyBob guess so

@VBluesBillyBob just making an observation

@VBluesBillyBob ....no, I'm not trying to pick up girls on Twitter. Or girls at all.

@joewentworth you can do normal things on it too...like wedding floor plans haha

@VBluesBillyBob that makes more sense

@VBluesBillyBob uhh 70¬∞...did you go down to Florida? Haha

@bond2tj you can tell me on Saturday night! Yay so excited :)

@NYsocialbee they are so cute! Congratulations!

@VBluesBillyBob I saw a commercial for that movie not too long ago

@VBluesBillyBob that is good news

@VBluesBillyBob hippie commune mindset

@VBluesBillyBob put in some Beatles while you read!

@VBluesBillyBob agreed, but I feel like you just described the bus scene in the movie

@VBluesBillyBob now you're describing across the universe

@RandiMShaffer applebees?

@RandiMShaffer so depressing. But at least we have fake high school drama to follow to ease the pain

@VBluesBillyBob well this story just gets better and better doesn't it

RT @SpencerHaworth: You know you're getting old when you're ready for bed at 8:30 #oldmanprobs

@VBluesBillyBob I assumed bit was a girl. It seems like a more girly name.

@VBluesBillyBob I just did...a story told by a character named bit. Not my cup of tea. I possibly just judged a book by its cover. #oops

@VBluesBillyBob yeah can't say it's a book I'd want to read

@RandiMShaffer I DID NOT KNOW THAT. And it makes me super sad. I also feel like 1018 may have been paying their rent

@VBluesBillyBob sounds fascinating....#sarcasm

@RandiMShaffer um, reopen? Explain.

@VBluesBillyBob and it doesn't help if it's a book you have no interest in reading

@VBluesBillyBob is there a movie haha
