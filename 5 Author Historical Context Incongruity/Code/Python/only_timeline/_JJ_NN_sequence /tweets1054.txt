I love British accents, when they say "Love you to bits" I want to die!

I seriously get American and British words mixed up all the time.

@luke_brooks Okay I want you to answer this, is it weird that I feel better about myself when British and Australian guys call me beautiful?

I love when British and Australian people call me hot or Beautiful.
