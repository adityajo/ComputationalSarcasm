Seems to be some confusion over Henry the player &amp; Henry the pundit . Not rating him as a pundit does not mean not respecting the player

Seen many much worse performances with better results. Players gave their all. Credit Sunderland for defensive display.

I like Stevie G. Brilliant footballer who provided Liverpool with so much. Seems to have remained pretty normal in ridiculous football world

RT @Naz_AFC1: Seen Bale do everything he can to win this match. While Ronaldo is just chilling

@arsenalvision (should say break not brawl ffs). A 2-0 would have been deserved. Seen us play a lot lot worse. Frustrated but not angry

@William_U21 dunno if he means Cesc should answer why. Seems to me more to the transfer than we said no to him. In my opinion

Seeing Invincibles rounding on RvN put a smile of my face.giggs &amp; Lauren squaring up.Ronaldo slapping then running b4 Cole could punch him

@Ashraf12AFC no longer outraged. Seen too much. Not a level playing field. I've accepted what I'm watching is not 100% real.

Can be in complete control but if goals are given against you when they shouldn't stand it changes the game. See Hull's first goal too

Seen a range to Monreal passing lately that never seen before. Playing centre-back enables those long diagonal passes

Seems Tim has come out of the AGM looking a bit silly in light of claims he has made in the public domain before today. #IvanKnows

Seen some if the most attractive football played. 

Seen some really nice stuff from Jack tonight. His start to this season has been very good.

@Waters90 are you using twitter with your hands above your head or hands stretched out wide of your body? Seen many a pen given against us
