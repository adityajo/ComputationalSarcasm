I swear, something is wrong with the members of my family.. Half of them are literally insane!😡

I've never been perfect, but neither have you.

I guess I should stop procrastinating now...

I wish I had a voice like these people on American Idol. I don't think I'd EVER stop singing!

I cannot explain how ready I am for graduation!

Tomorrow's another day & I'm thirsty anyway, so bring on the rain.
