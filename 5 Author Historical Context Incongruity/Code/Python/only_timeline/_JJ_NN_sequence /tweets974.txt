@katiebeth102 oh do it anyway. My face is more embarrassing than your laugh. Except when you turn red in the face, but I got that on video.

@katiebeth102 nope. I am positive I would me never do something so immature. Like ride a bike in Dixon basement.

It is seriously crazy how much my life has changed, especially since this day last year. #change #intense

Instead of being caught by the police, tonight we outran them. #nobigdeal #latenightadventures @Anna_Kaitlyn193 @AshleyBrooke811 🏃🚓🚓

@katiebeth102 @Sarah_LizSmith all I can say is oh bless...

I guess breaking promises is your specialty. 💔💔💔

Well instead of being at the lake, I get to spend all night and tomorrow in the hospital. WITHOUT MY GRANDMOTHER. #biggirlprobs

Well I hope @Anna_Kaitlyn193 is having a fun time at the lake without me. #getthattanon ☀☀☀

All I want to do is crawl into bed and stay there forever. #please

I seriously would rather go to class, than be sick. #sickly

I have already seen @steve_condra this morning where is dear Wado.

After take care of 30 kids under the age of 12 by myself, with only the drug filled @mbrookebishop! I am enjoying some late night taco bell!

I really just feel like sleeping till I leave for college next week. #toomuchdrama #hatemylife #needstoleave #9days #fhu

@MBrookeBishop I know! I thought you were just playing around! I hope your cheeks get deflated chubby bunny!

I hope that @mbrookebishop is feels better and doesn't start crying because she can't drink from a straw. #poorbaby #loveyou

RT @ItsAGirIThing: I love people who can make me laugh when I don't even want to smile.

Looking at Wisdom teeth videos with @mbrookebishop so I know how to tease her tomorrow! #goingtobefunny

10 Days till I leave! #FHU #college #excited #August18th #wahh

@MBrookeBishop oh my goodness this makes me want to cry! I love you! #bestfriend #aww

If I am in a house, where the people own a snake. The second it comes out of its cage, I am gone. #truetweet #hatessnakes

Realizing that this might be the last time I am ever in that house. #sadtweet #memories #wahhhh

I seriously hate having memory loss problems! #ugh #hateit #blahh

It just seems to be every tweet I see now, puts me in a bad mood. #seriously #whereistheicecream

Today I learned that driving a jet ski after a storm is the best time to do it. #lakeday #bigwaves #ramping

RT @reallymilly: I know more than you think I do.

I just can't bring myself to care. #thatisbad #seriously

I have a grand total of 150 pictures to get printed for my photo collage. That is after down sizing from like 500 pictures. #whooo

Can I have a time machine to take me back to when things were not so difficult? #please #likenow

All I can say is that God knows what needs to happen, so all I can do is pray for the right thing to happen. #prayinghard

"If I lost, I would just shoot myself!-@dbppellasinger " #mademynight

If I seriously lived in a big city like Atlanta, I would give all my money to homeless people. #sad

It is burning biscuits! #Braves #Atlanta

Kissing headphone/radar guns! @mbrookebishop http://t.co/ojVoVJIg

In three weeks at this time I will be at Freed- Hardeman! #wahhhh #21days

I love you! @Anna_Kaitlyn193 #seriously

Well I didn't want or need to see that person in a million years. #creepyperson #badmemories

All this is hitting me in the face at once, I just can't deal. Just know that I have more difficult things going on in my life than drama.

It is sad when you can barely understand a word your sister is saying...

It is kinda sad I eat ice cream to cheer me up... #sad #midnightsnack #comfortfood

Would I be looked down upon if I throw a tantrum? #probably #ohwell #wahhh #ughhhh #needstoscream

I can not explain the feelings I have over both these two stupid situations.. #badfeelings #ineedaanswer #wahhh #somepeoplemakememad

I am seriously laying in the floor trying to wrap my head around this. #mindblown #confused

Poor Cloe puppy, I had to force feed her Benadryl. #poorpuppy #shesick

I just can't deal! #wahhhh

Is it better to act like nothing is wrong or confront your problems?

I feel like I have been here before. #wehave @Anna_Kaitlyn193

I just don't know what to do anymore. The people I love the most and are closest to have pretty much grown to be complete strangers.

Sometimes I just want to scream... #ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I am a very nice person, but when I want to run your over with a truck....it is pretty bad. @MBrookeBishop

I feel like I am on a emotional rollercoaster. #iamdone

Tomorrow I am probably going to make some people shocked and confused and other things. But... #idontcare #getready #timetochange #benice

The first night I can go out without being sick, we go bowling with little kids. #goodness #bowling #ohwell

Today has been eventful, and very scary and I hope that @Anna_Kaitlyn193 has a safe trip home. #missyou #shotguns #rebelflags #bigdogs #cats

RT @amberelisenoles: I'm so ready to be at Freed-Hardeman in the fall.

While everyone is buying food at Walmart, I buy tissues. I am sickly... http://t.co/pEhnwft9

Watching some sort of baseball game with Connie, and I am so clueless. #whatisgoingon

You can scream and lecture me all you want, but I am not listening to a word you say.

I feel and look like death. #sick #ughh

I just love teasing @MBrookeBishop about not going to church. #loveya #joking

Apparently I am "self-destructive", and I am headed down a bad road. #ohgoodness #readytoleave #shutup

RT @frshmn16prblms: Can I just know my roommate already?? #dyingoverhere #frshmn16prblms

@MBrookeBishop Bahaha. I think they were shocked I did that!

I go in to see what is the matter with me, and I get 3 tubes of blood drawn and a shot. #stupiddoctors

I have no energy at all. #stupidsickness #killmenow

Who knew that a stupid blood test could decide if I go to Freed or not. #stupiddoctors  #sickly

I think there is something seriously wrong with me. #migranes #blackouts #ohgoodess

Being treated like I did something wrong, but I have no idea what. #peopletheseday #makesmemad

I better see your faces tommorrow! @Anna_Kaitlyn193 @LaurenHarrison7 @Ashlynnstults

So far 2012 has been the most drama filled and terrible year, I hope the rest of the year will be better. #doubtit #tomuchdrama

@Ashlynnstults I know! But we still have to celebrate it! Anna Won't be back till saturday. Then me and anna leave the ninth for ardmore.

@MBrookeBishop Okay! I am not feeling good at all again! Hope your car is okay!

@Anna_Kaitlyn193 It is so bittersweet! We have to make the most of the rest of our time!

50 days till I leave for Freed!!! #wahhhh #soexciting #college

@Anna_Kaitlyn193 Oh goodie! I feel so behind!!

@Anna_Kaitlyn193 I know, if not, I think I will go crazy! And we have lots to talk about Ms. Anna! ;)

@MBrookeBishop I know! It been like a century since I seen you!!

@Anna_Kaitlyn193 Yea I do! I miss you so much! I think this is the longest we all haven't hung out!

It seems as if I haven't seen any of my friends in like forever! #missyall @Anna_Kaitlyn193 @Ashlynnstults @LaurenHarrison7 @MBrookeBishop

I never have been so mad in my entire life. #justwanttohitsomething #ughhhh

Sometimes I just wish that everything could be like before, but knowing it can't just makes me want to cry. #sadtweet

After water sliding, zip lining, and swimming all day, I feel like I am about to fall out! #longday #summer2012

All I know is that it is going to be a weekend long of math. #stupidsummerclass

@MBrookeBishop No I am joking. Not our fault, we don't want to do that!

When you say "maybe", it automatically means no, but I am too nice to hurt your feelings and I am giving you hope @MBrookeBishop #loveya

It makes me so mad when people just send, "k". Please spell it out. #pleaseandthankyou

Mad that I didn't make it back in time for @dbppellasinger singing thing. #sadtweet

I have the worse memory in the world. #lostmyroomkey

I have arrived in the place that i will spend the next four years! #soexcited #FHU #allsmiles

"I want my ticket, and I wanna get in Brookes bed!" -@dbppellasinger @Ashlynnstults @MBrookeBishop @Anna_Kaitlyn193

I am going to be the only senior in the whole entire school. #fail #wantstosleep #yearbookproblems

I now understand why so many teens run away each year. #ughhhh #shutup #somad #wantstoscream #seriously #joking

At least she didn't take my phone, because if she did I would have went off! #somad

I try to do the best I can, I don't drink or smoke, I go to church and have good grades. Yet I am treated as if I am the worst child ever.

My Brooke! With the floatie! @mbrookebishop http://t.co/jMwY4vI5

I wonder what my grandmother would do if I just didn't come home... #hmmm #notreally #shekillme

I love @Anna_Kaitlyn193 big kitty! #sosweet #sopretty
