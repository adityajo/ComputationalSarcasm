I will buy you a garden, where your flowers can bloom.

While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you.

I thought I heard the door open, oh. I thought I heard the door open, but I only heard it close.

I think I saw you in my dreams. You were stitching up the seams on every broken promise that your body couldn't keep.

What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? You're the pretender.

Don't hold me up now, I can stand my own ground. I don't need your help now. You will let me down, down, down.

So do you think that we could work out a sign? So I'll know it's you, and that it's over, so I won't even try.

I know you think that I'm someone you can trust, but I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up .

Do I divide and fall apart? Cause my bright is too slight, to hold back all my dark.

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die, I'm a little bit scared of what comes after.

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again.

With nobody in your bed, the night's hard to get through. And I will die all alone.

If they don't put me away, well, it'll be a miracle.

I like today.

So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you. I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you.

Truth be told, I miss you. And truth be told, I'm lying.

I just can't keep up with you.

I can't wait till Halloween for many reasons. One of them is definitely Dante's Inferno.

I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out. Find nothing but faith in nothing.

I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds. But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside.

I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom.

Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on.

Well I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all.

I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way. Why don't you get a job?

I love you, but I'm not the answer for the questions you still have.

She said, "I don't hate you. Boy, I just want to save you, while there's still something left to save."

@OzDa59 I know, I had no idea either. Good thing I have people like that to let me know and keep me informed though :-)

Hey guys, apparently I'm a cunt. Glad someone told me, cause I had no idea.

I love how I was having a bad day so @adrianahcupcake came and picked me up and now I can't even remember why I was mad. friendship.

Centuries are what it meant to me. A cemetery where I marry the sea.

I hate you for every kind word you ever said.

If the real thing don't do the trick, you better make up something quick. You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it out to the wick.

You might think I'm losing my mind, but I will shy away from the specifics.

I want you to stay.

Funny, you're the broken one, but I'm the only one who needed saving.

Call me a safe bet. I'm betting I'm not.

It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room, when I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds.

I can see clearly now, the rain is gone. I can see all obstacles in my way. Gone of the dark clouds that had me blind.

Its really good to hear your voice saying my name, it sounds so sweet.

RT @theugliestdays: oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? rt “@obesedogs420: I saw my reflection in snow covered hills, till the landslide b…

I saw my reflection in snow covered hills, till the landslide brought me down.

RT @WhoIs_Art: Monday is going to suck .

RT @hipstermermaid: I can’t read your mind, but I have read your blog.

What I really want to say, I can't define.

@LXIX_ keep learning guitar

I walked into the room dripping, in gold.

It's true, I crave you.

Why don't you want me like the other boys do? They stare at me, while I stare at you.

While you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you.

@stasiuuuuhh That would be amazing!! If I can get money for the tickets, I will definitely take you up on that offer :) Thanks

So don't fall in love, theres just too much to lose. And if given the choice then Im begging you, choose to walk away, don't let it get you.

Please don't be sad now, I really believe you were the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

Now son, I'm only telling you this because life can do terrible things.

wilfred is RUINED

@Awesome_Os FUCKING GARY. SPOILERS. SPOILERS. WHY THIS.

I'll be dead before the day, is, done.

I am bad out shout outs.

well shit I passed my 40k tweet but this is just as good I guess. Shout out to @driffingavis his tweets are amazing and he is really nice

RT @driffingavis: this is it. http://t.co/88IYqJ1eS9

I thought I was a fool for no one, but oh baby, I'm a fool for you.

RT @Brendan_Shively: I really love boobs

Oh baby, don't you know I suffer. Oh baby, can you hear me moan?

@Stuuuuucie I love you

In the tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, "Sometimes all of our thoughts are misleading."

I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind. I feel free, now.

I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees.

Call my name through the cream, and I'll hear you scream again.

Paint the mirrors black, to forget you. I still picture your face, and the way you used to taste.

Well I'm so, empty. I'm better off without you, and you're better off without me.

Promises you broke, words you choked on. And I never walked away, it's still a mystery to me.

Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me.

I'm your national anthem. God, you're so handsome.

Am I your one and only desire? Am I the reason you breathe? Or am I the reason you cry.

You and I in a little toy shop, buy a bag of balloons with the money we got.

RT @driffingavis: and when you decided to give up on me, I decided to give up on me too.

One time someone passed me a note in elementary school and it said "will you be my girlfriend yes or no?" And I circled or.

If you don't like paper planes you're wrong and I hate you

All I wanna do is [gunshot noise] [gunshot noise] [gunshot noise] [gunshot noise] and [cash register noise] and take ya money.

I fly like paper, get high like planes.

NEIN

@Awesome_Os I'm shocked and appalled at this information!

@LXIX_ :-) I thought so.

I HATE IT WHEN YOU THINK YOUR NAIL POLISH IS DRY AND THEN YOU TOUCH IT AND IT SMUDGES LIKE I JUST WORKED SO HARD ON YOU HOW DARE YOU SMUDGE

RT @BIockedURL: Brown eyes are so cute

"I HAVE TO PEE." I scream as I continued to lay in the same spot that I have in been for an hour.

I wish I could just sleep for the rest of my life.

RT @dropdeadlexis: "I'm so sick of your kind, get the fuck out of my life.'

@Norbo1995 I was like "thats really embarresing" when you didnt notice it ahhaha xD

RT @Norbo1995: @obesedogs420 As if I've only just seen this tweet because I randomly twitter searched 'Norb' xD

I SENT A REALLY NICE MESSAGE TO ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGS SAYING THAT I LOVED THEIR BLOG AND THEY FOLLOWED ME BACK KINDNESS DOES PAY OFF WOW

BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD PUMP MUD THROUGH MY VEINS SHUT YOUR DIRTY DIRTY MOUTH I'M NOT THAT EASY

RT @IAmBlackDom: @obesedogs420 who wants sleep anyway, it's basically like dying, except you wake up

I heard you say, right when you left that day, "Does everything go away?" Yeah, everything goes away. But I'm going to be here 'til forever.

RT @EcheMadubuike: #WhatWouldYouChangeAboutYourPast so many stupid mistakes and time I wasted on certain people who aren't even in my life …

All my life, I've never known where you've been. There were holes in you, the kind that I could not mend.

You can blame me when there's no one left to blame, I don't mind.

@IAmBlackDom haha probably, that's when i write best.

It cut me sharp hearing you'd gone away, but everything goes away. Yeah, everything goes away.

@IAmBlackDom that was very poetic

RT @imnotjakee: I NEED TACO BELL BRUH.

I want to go out in the world and find myself and experience life for what it really is, but I'm stuck in this little shithole of a town.

You kept me guessing, and now I'm destined to spend my time missing you. I almost wish you would've loved me too.

I almost had you, but I guess that doesn't cut it.

RT @MVF42X0: It sucks being a thinker sometimes I wish I could just mindlessly live by instinct

Just when I had you off my head, your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed.

RT @MVF42X0: I think I just might be destined to be a loner for the rest of my life.

I never show just what you do to me. Guess I'm what's always wrong.

I never know the things to say to you, that help me prove that I'm still on your side.

I hate this town, it's so washed up. And all my friends don't give a fuck.

In the sun, in the sun I feel as one.

What else could I say? Everyone is gay.

I'm addic- I'm addicted to you.

RT @fucktyler: THEY NEVER DID CATCH THAT RHINOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I've been thinking 'bout you. Do you think about me still? Or do you not think so far ahead? 'Cause I've been thinking 'bout forever.

so earlier i thought mom forgot to get me oreos from the store but i jUST FOUND THEM AND I LITERALLY SCREAMED AND WOKE EVERYONE UP BC OREOS

RT @_aikma95: I must be wrong in the head

EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW

@OzDa59 I know. I would have never guessed.

I THOUGHT THAT ALL THOSE GUYS IN SKYRIM HAD LITERALLY BEEN SHOT IN THEIR KNEES WITH ARROWS BUT I GUESS NOT

OH MY GOD APPARENTLY TAKING AN ARROW TO THE KNEE WAS AN OLD NORDIC SLANG FOR GETTING MARRIED

I just don't even feel like trying anymore.

It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room, when I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds. So call it quits, or get a grip.

If the sky opened up and started pouring rain, like he knew it was time to start things over again. It'd be all right, it's all right.

I've got desperate desires, and unadmirable plans. My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent.

Call me a safe bet. I'm betting I'm not.

If they don't put me away, well, it'll be a miracle.
