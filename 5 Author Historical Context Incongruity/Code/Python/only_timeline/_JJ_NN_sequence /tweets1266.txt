RT @miilkkk: Don't you hate it when you start missing someone and you wonder if they even think about you.

@karolineeb It better go away. Pronto.

I have huge ant bites on my feet from @thatguy_lol 's house. üëéüëéüëé

RT @t_ravis08: I don't know what's out there or what's waiting for me but whatever it's is, ill find it

@thatguy_lol Whatever makes you happy!

@thatguy_lol You really aren't funny at all.

@thatguy_lol Curtain student? Hahah.

@thatguy_lol Why should I? You aren't there.

@thatguy_lol Come on then. I'm not scared.

@thatguy_lol @katherineb13 You still wouldn't do anything!

@thatguy_lol Me too!

@thatguy_lol @katherineb13 That may be true, but you don't know where I live.

@thatguy_lol Oh, gosh. Jared said something about seeing one when we got back from Rosenberg.

@KatherineB13 @thatguy_lol Don't worry, he's lying.

@thatguy_lol Then you're safe. :) Seriously?! Where was it?

@thatguy_lol I'm sorry, I'm already comfortable. Got your paintball gun?

@thatguy_lol Awww, would you like us to come back? Haha.

@thatguy_lol Don't be a baby.

RT @ZHen95: People confuse me, just be true to yourself. If you have to change who you are, then they're not worth it. 

RT @AlyssaBurgess: ‚Äú@funnyortruth: In the end, we just regret the chances we didn't take.‚Äù

@karolineeb No! Some random lady at a gas station!

@karolineeb It wasn't me!

@thatguy_lol I really need too!

RT @kelbell164: Guys that love Jesus. #ThatsSoAttractive

@thatguy_lol I don't have an aux cord!

@SamJarHac That's not exactly what I meant. üòí

@thatguy_lol I know.. It's such a lonely drive. Julie sleeps and I can't use my phone. üò¢

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol Shut up, Austin. üî´

@thatguy_lol @way2bthtguy that was I say doesn't make sense!!

@thatguy_lol @way2bthtguy What's that supposed to mean?!

@thatguy_lol @way2bthtguy Then no, not an insult.

@thatguy_lol @way2bthtguy I feel like that made no sense. Haha.

@thatguy_lol @way2bthtguy Was that supposed to be an insult?

@marioservin10 Those are pretty great as well. :)

@marioservin10 Yes sir! It is very entertaining. :)

@marioservin10 thanks! That's because I'm twitter creepin. Hahaha.

@marioservin10 and you haven't seen me since! Haha.

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol Hahaha, you're hilarious. That boy's not a saint.

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol I'm just speaking the truth!

@thatguy_lol You're the one who's lying!

@thatguy_lol That's what I KNOW.

@thatguy_lol Seeing that barely anyone in the town knows anything about DSP makes that very hard to believe.

@marioservin10 :( It's not like that anymore!

@thatguy_lol Oh, yes. Because it is soo exciting there...

@way2bthtguy @colbywallace @thatguy_lol I'll be there tomorrow! Well actually Brazoria.

@thatguy_lol What's that song called?

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol @colbywallace What's the guy's name that sings that?

@way2bthtguy Hmmmm, whatever you say.

@way2bthtguy Why is that awkward? Haha.

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol IT WAS SARCASM.

@marioservin10 It never tells me you replied!! I don't see it until I'm checking the connect tab.

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol Well for one, it was sarcastic, and two, I was referring to both of you.

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol That's a cute face...

RT @enknoch: When there's no one else around, I will still be here.

@thatguy_lol Gotcha!

@thatguy_lol What about them?

@thatguy_lol I wish I wasn't. Haha.

@thatguy_lol Unfortunately, even truly understanding that doesn't make it feel any better.

@thatguy_lol No, it definitely is not. Nothing worth having in life is.

@SamJarHac Yes sir. I'll be back Sunday afternoon. I'll be at the World's Religion class if we have it.

@thatguy_lol A virtue I wish I had.

RT @way2bthtguy: Fools do not want to understand anything. They only want to tell others what they think. (Proverbs 18:2) #indeedSo

@marioservin10 Yes! I feel like its gonna go away again though! Haha.

@SamJarHac I'm out of town!

‚Äú@TexasHumor: Life is too short for diets that exclude enchiladas.‚Äù hahaha.

@colbywallace @Krit_Wallace I wish I could be there to meet Noah, but I'll definitely be praying for all of you!

@JillianKMoss @hannahraewatts Shame on you, Jillian.

@marioservin10 How can you not reach  them?!

@AbigaleHines Who's Charlie?

@way2bthtguy @thatguy_lol Man, I'm having conflicting feelings. I waited until I was 18 so I could, but now I don't know if I want too. Ha.

@thatguy_lol @way2bthtguy Hmmm, okay! I'll have to think about it.
