@lucero1638_g I didn't! You don't trust me at all anymore. What proof do you have?

I don't need someone like you. I need someone who cares and actually believes what I say cuz I wasn't lying. I never talked to someone else.

Wtf r u smoking that makes you think I'd do that?

If you love someone stay with them. Don't leave them.

"I love you" she said. FALSE STATEMENT!!

@lozwhitex I've been not too well. Almost at where I started.

@lozwhitex I may have to go back to the hospital again. So fucking pissed about that.

I miss that feeling from the morphine at the hospital too. So good.

Mood is lowest of the low rn. All I wanna do is drink til I drop.

@Pullsen really wierd cuz I got shot right between the eyes before the round that I got shot in te eye

@Pullsen that's ok I do too

I'm such a fucking idiot

@Pullsen haha. Uh btw sorry but kinda dropped ur bandana and lost it. I looked and looked but couldn't find it. I can pay u back.

I had the gut feeling that I would get shot cuz I felt like I should have brought my safety glasses.

@Pullsen some damage to vision but I think it should b ok

I knew this day would come. Today I was shot in the eye in Airsoft. Fucking hurts like hell.

nobody is gonna understand that Five Million Dollar Man title reference. except now since I just told you. :p

@lozwhitex I read the book but the move looks really good

possibly going to Belcher Town State School/Asylum this weekend. FINALLY!

A good practice session yet again. #Disturbed #AsILayDying #SingTraining

@lozwhitex I hope everything clears up. if u ever need anything just ask.

nvm my XBL didn't run out. Internet is just screwy.

@lozwhitex I'd ask if I could help but I don't think  can on this matter.

I'm such a bad traitor on TTT. xD

Obama: I sold it *long pause* for 10 bananas

@lozwhitex I havent

I am so fuckin pumped for Wednesday. Progressing my music career!

@lozwhitex haha I guess R.D. Jr. is out of the picture?

@lozwhitex the ending of Tor I was just like omg. haha great movie though. killing me w the ending though.

I'm surprised my dagger still has some blood on it. it reminds me how much I've changed.

@lozwhitex im honestly nervous meetong new people. apparently I look scared talking to people I haven't really met b4.

@lozwhitex whats the legal age? im 17 but may probs gonna b older when I go and idk when to go cuz itd have to b a good time to visit

@lozwhitex lol. when I go to wales me and u r hitting the bar. idea #1 for what to do.

@lozwhitex I do too but people are around so I cant. h8 it

I am a proud patriotic person but its hard to support ur country when everyone in charge is a moron.

by country I mean government. some Americans are no better though!

I smell a civil war. the condtions are VERY much like before the American Revolution that founded our now greed and power hungry country

So China is buyng USA banks now. Why don't we just sell the fucking country! is America a company or a country?! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

and I'm still afraid of the light, as a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise

In the back of my mind I can barely even remember when, there was nothing left to hide, she found a way inside

RT @lozwhitex: Whenever I read a word like 'hydrochloric' I always hear my science teachers voice in my head saying it

@lozwhitex I love plot twists lol

@Pullsen I was gonna write an elegy about me

@Pullsen when ur not feeling good u don't wanna do much anyways. I cant find the initiative to get my lazy ass up and work out.

@Pullsen I haven't sung in like a few weeks until this week.

@Pullsen I don't have a home vocal booth or mic so....

I only eat 56% of the recommended daily calorie intake for me.

I run on low fuel. no wonder I always feel hungry

All my devotion retrieved, I am no longer afraid, I was to blinded to see how much you've stolen from me

I should really get to work on my lion arm tat design. need new pattern ideas...

I just want her to eat and be strong.

I love the new Windows 8 update.

I will be jamming to Disturbed rest of the night

GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS

Is it weird I still want bite piercings on my lower lip?

I just held cleo for the first time today. she loves me. :3

Only through struggle have I found rest, with a piece of me taken away, I begin to understand

Remove from me, this deception that I call love

@Pullsen she was smelling my hand I was like "im not prey so don't bite me". lol. she listens and knows im in charge.

going to get the new night bulb so I can stop worrying about Cleo's cage temp.

Turns out I cant completely delete it cuz my account is till on my laptop (on it rn). so this jjst means less interactions. bye for now

Bye friends ily all (u know if ur my friend). Maybe I'll return to the twitterverse someday. Those who have me on Skype just talk anytime

@Pullsen impossible. I can't. Even if it goes away it'll creep back up worse than before. And this was pretty bad this time tbh

@dannybwoi49 @lozwhitex np. Ily two. U guys always make me feel better.

@dannybwoi49 @lozwhitex I'm not ditching u two as friends too. Forgot to mention that. I couldn't ditch u guys.

@dannybwoi49 @lozwhitex no like as a whole. I'm done w so many people. I'm keeping Skype though.

@lozwhitex how do I disconnect twitter? Do I just delete my account?

I haven't felt this down in a long time. There goes the grace period, nice while it lasted.

How did I go from happy to crappy. Wow

Idek if this other last bulb is gonna glow out either! It's her last source of heat! Stupid cheap bulbs...

Stupid Zilla products FUCKING SUCK

FUUUUCK! THE FUCKING NIGHT BULB JUST BLEW OUT! DX

Holy shit this snake is more curious than curious George! She hasn't stopped checking things out since I put her in her new home. :)

@RadBananaman sorry but it's true. Plus it's my game. I choose who can play it plus dad says ur not allowed to play GTA V.

@Pullsen @TenaciousDbag ok. If I come and bring GTA V I don't mind u guys playing but u know who will prob hog it forever.

@Pullsen @TenaciousDbag @RadBananaman Alex didn't invite me really though so I'm not just gonna invite myself

@Pullsen @TenaciousDbag @RadBananaman I will have to stay and monitor her adjustment to the cage.

@Pullsen @TenaciousDbag @RadBananaman I'd love to go and show u guys GTA V. I can go if I don't have enough for the snake itself cuz if I do

Idk y but I've had Rapid Influx's trvp remix of te wii shop channel music stuck in my head for days.

@TenaciousDbag yes I'm a teen girl who idolizes porn stars what do I win?

I shaved for a fresh start to November and to clean up my look a little. Was looking really scraggly.

Good thing I'm an expert on snakes p much so I should b able to keep her alive her max age.

Going to get my python heat lamps later and if I have enough the python itself am it's food. I hep I have enough.

@lozwhitex aha my way of referring to people I don't like anymore.

@lozwhitex it's the only one I have without she who must not be named in it

@lozwhitex honestly I'm surprised u even like it. My nose I red an my chest is red and I'm all skinny and bony. Lol

Wish I had my pic of me that I looked like Matt Damon in it. It's a nice pic.

Right when I thought I had everything under control with this... GOD DAMN

So fucking tired. I can't sleep at all lately.

RT @apoptart: person: I like your name

me: thanks, I got it for my birthday

Whenever I like someone they either don't like me or like someone else. Wen someone likes me I either like someone else or don't care. WHY

I really wish it worked out between us. I still hate myself for however I messed up.

why do I have to fuck up w all my relationships. why do I always fail?

I hate this new twitter update. So dumb.

I feel so sick today. And I forgot to eat breakfast but YOLO I guess.

Ridiculously sociable today. I even talked to the girl I like a little bit in class today.

Idek what I want to ask for. Few things I have ideas for.

@lozwhitex chill stuff I suggest. Like some trance or DnB.

@lozwhitex oh lol. draw then. that's what I do. or even listen to music.

@lozwhitex ik. soometies I wish I didn't have them. read and cool off or something to ease ur mind.

@lozwhitex parents r like that. my mom said I could go get a tattoo but right when the day came she said no. like wtf. I am still pissed.

@lozwhitex that is kinda dumb. I couldn't even sleep on the couch next to lilly a while back when she always fell asleep on me.

@lozwhitex I understand what u mean but what exactly is it she is against u doing? that's probably y.

@Pullsen the more closed my throat is the higher I make it go and the stronger I use my diaphragm the higher it goes

@Pullsen i push the scream from my diaphragm not from the throat but mouth the notes to get the sound I want

I found out how to scream w a tremolo type effect

So tired today. And I have a speech to give tonight for elections. The public speaking.

Damn I almost won that race

Of course I say for the game to give a random vehicle to race w and it gives me the slowest, shittiest car there is to pick from. Lol

Just same up w some ridiculously deep lyrics that for odd reasons I put in my Skype bio :p

I want a ouija board

Woman: Officer I've lost my wig!

Cop: Don't worry I'll have officers comb the area.

@TenaciousDbag where is this place I must go there

My friend hit me w a limo then while I was getting up he got out and shot me in the face. I'm still laughing at it. xD

I have too much fun on GTA V. Lol

@lozwhitex the newest one? I played a little bit of it and it's amazing.

I wish I had selective memory cuz then I could forget whatever I wanted.

Today is a good day. Gaming pretty much all day cuz I can and haven't played video games in a long time.

Getting better control over my depression. Only thing is I can't control the anxiety attacks I get occasionally. :|

So I got my guy drunk and made him take a hit from a bong while drunk. DOUBLE WHAMMY.

I got ran over by a bicycle. It killed me. How even....

I absolutely love my custom car on GTA V. So sick. Changing the color back to sunset red though. Gray is overdone.

"Oh boo hoo, I hope you choke on a spork."

Bored and lonely (despite being around stupid classmates). I have no friends in any of my classes. Lol

@Pullsen @lozwhitex @PixlatedNoise @TenaciousDbag if I don't have emoji if say "nice boxes" lol

Later bitches I can play pokemon on my phone now :D

@Pullsen @SNCKPCK na I'm good. And I take that screaming from Evan that ur in ft rn. Lol

@Pullsen @SNCKPCK wtf made me so upset. I didn't do anything at all today to make me like this. :/

I was doing so good now im feeling down again. god damn.

@Pullsen yep. If it is his ex then I feel bad cuz I think she pretty.

@Pullsen the dirty blonde hair girl whose around my height? I think she was wearing a leather jacket?

I just saw a girl that looked exactly like Lilly. Im goin crazy...

Our tears can show the way,I will climb my way to heaven, and bring it back to you!

@TheKoolNinjaGuy greater than Gatsby himself. It was good.

If someone removes u on Skype and u havent removed them can u still see their contact or does it remove it for u?

Yay I have art today. Wish I had double art classes like my freshman year.

I gotta go cuz HIMYM and GTA V. See u all tomorrow my friends.

@Pullsen ik right and also it'd b so RIBOSOMES PRODUCE ENYZMES FOR THE CELL

I like how u can tweet one word an have someone w a bio similar to that word follow u. Example: DJ

Thank you to all who helped me see clearly what and how I have been. I love my friends. Starting to get more positive already!

YES I GOT GTA V

@lozwhitex Its not too great of a phone. Galaxy is better aside from its massive size.

I still need a TTT and prop hunt crew. :/

@LP3X I just troll on it. Gonna troll my buddy w the cargo chopper xD

@numiiigoesrawrz for everyone I will.

If it is gonna hurt my friends and family then I'm going to change for the better. Already getting over her too.

Better get a grip before I do something stupid.

@numiiigoesrawrz sorry. I scare everyone. Trying to feel better now.

@numiiigoesrawrz I'm alive don't worry ang

At least I get GTA V today. Makes me a little happier.

@lozwhitex I'll try. Thnx again Lauren for being there to talk. I appreciate it.

@lozwhitex I said I'd b more positive and optimistic.

@lozwhitex I'm sorry I failed u

@Pullsen NOTHING HELPS. It goes away temporarily at most and not for long. It always comes back worse. G2g. Bye

When this world fades away, I will see you again

You meant the world to me, all I have now are memories.

OMFG THIS REMIX...

@lozwhitex I hope so. thnx lauren. &lt;3

u say u have no friends but I have been tryng to fix shit between us for MONTHS and u just don't see it or care.

A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME! ALL THAT TORTURE ADN AFFECTION WASTED ON SOMEONE WHO SHOULDNT DESERVE IT.

@Pullsen idk I prefer Eminence over claxton. X-Ray is probably one of their best.

Starting to get really good at being the traitor on TTT. If only I could shoot more accurately. Lol

@lozwhitex I always end up playing prop hunt when I need to type something :p

@TenaciousDbag y u do dis. U ratted me out now I gotta cut u up m8

My Steam ID has caught on quite a bit. My friend even changed his to the same thing just with a period on the end that u don't really notice

So I get to the store and the guy say tey just sold out of copies. Only this would happen to me. xD

I hate being sensitive. Cuz it kills me in certain situations.

@lozwhitex that's ok. I was really tired myself around when te call was gonna be. Lol

@lozwhitex k. I hope u feel better. Poor u :(

@lozwhitex sorry if I'm being annoying but is 3 good time or no

K I'm done bye

If making me feel like an asshole even more is how u plan on helping ok. Clearly that's how to help ur bf who feels shitty as it is. üòû

@RadBananaman @Pullsen WOW EASY ON THE RACISM

Lost myself again. Nvm. Who am I again? :|

@ssweiit it's on his soundcloud so I'll just share it.

@ssweiit u hear Homebound yet? It's only a short clip but it's soo good

I feel like myself for the first time in two years. If only I could share this feeling with Lilly rn.

@Pullsen haha I try to hard and I'm not quick on the draw for jokes. Bout to tweet a bad pun though.

I'd make a comedy page if I was funny.

"I feel like it would b therapeutic for me to start a watermelon farm"-GassyMexican aka Max

@lozwhitex aw u didn't get to see his duck like face. I was going to delete it myself. I never use it.

@lozwhitex ok. I was gonna ask if u saw the snap chat of the character me and nick and my bro made on saints row

@lozwhitex now I confused myself

@lozwhitex sorry I thought u replaced ur old one cuz u lost it

Yay got my anti virus software installed. Now my laptop has more protection against computer AIDS.

I feel so sick but I can't miss school again. God damn!

In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die

Should I get dressed and go back to sleep? Idk. School in an hour or so...

@lozwhitex yay. I'm gonna tell u about tht Airsoft game on Monday. It was awesome.

@lozwhitex ok. Haven't asked to much cuz ik ur busy lately. Just gimme a time if u can and I'll try.

I am so grounded when I get back home...

I'm not myself right now...

Fun day shooting and getting shot at. My team kicked ass! Great day for Airsoft! I really needed this.

@Pullsen good for u. I'm gonna go get shot at now. LoL maybe later.

@Pullsen but I guess to remix it u have to listen to the original and figure out how to mess w it and it's quite advanced so yeh

@Pullsen I don't mean like now but eventually. It'd b cool to hear another remix cuz there's only one remix of it.

All my gear is ready for the day! LETS DO THIS!!

@Pullsen cool. Do a remix of a remix of Elegy by As I Lay Dying.

Watching the Walking Dead season 4 premier soon then hittin the hay cuz I need my energy for tomorrow. So bye.

RT @DictatorHitler: I believe in hate at first sight.

Convincing myself again, this god that I worship, this demon I blame, conspire as one, it's exactly the same, it's exactly the same.

I feel like how Isaac hallucinates Nicole in the Dead Space series rn.

WTF DO U WANT FROM ME?! GTFO OF MY HEAD!! YOURE TORTURING ME!!

@Pullsen nothing I just can't breathe

I can barely breathe rn. Feels like there's a ton of weight on my chest.

Another day of hell. Yay. I do love waking up to b mentally tortured.

@lozwhitex I don't have school tomorrow cuz it's Columbus Day

@dannybwoi49 @TenaciousDbag I can't b normal. This Monday is gonna b the only day I am probably. Cuz Airsoft.

@TenaciousDbag if I take any drugs I'm just gonna od honestly.

@TenaciousDbag yeah "hey dad I'm gonna get black out drunk by cleaning u out of all ur beer"

I want to get drunk rn but people r home. Damn family...

@CaptainMystFire I have mine for half of the day then later at night all week long.

Haunted by u by day, night and my dreams. I see u everywhere and hear u everywhere. Just go away.

I could bleed out w no regrets rn. Just slit my throat.

@ssweiit lol k. Dead flesh maybe since I'm a zombie rn.

@ssweiit thnx. I hope so too.

@Pullsen depends on how drunk me acts I guess

Next chance I get im just gonna get blackout drunk. not even kidding.

People don't get that most of what I say on the internet is what my inner thoughts and self r usually. I'm different in person.

RT @FactsOfSchool: I

@Pullsen idk if she's mad or just sad I did all that stuff but either way I want to fix it still. End on good terms at least.

@Pullsen I have apologized yeah. Even if I get over it the memory will still eat at me.

That's what girls are for, making you feel like shit and escalating ur depression I guess.

@Pullsen she knows I feel bad and she still keeps me on everything and I keep wondering y.

I was so close to finally being over it then u have to say I broke our thing we had. Thanks now I feel even worse cuz it's all my fault.

GOD DAMNIT LILLY

Knife Party - 'Internet Friends VIP' by Knife Party http://t.co/QITl67zGAG on #SoundCloud

@Pullsen y would I want revenge if it's all my fault in the first place.

I was w u for 2 an a half months but did something wrong along the way. Pretty long time i was w u.

@Pullsen I'll talk to her again when I'm not feeling so ashamed.

@Pullsen she's making it difficult for me to decide ending it. I love her we but she drives me crazy.

Every fucking time I am almost completely over her she tried to fix things between us. No not this time. Not after how u treated me.

Is that Patrick Stewart walking into the Federal? WTF?!

Mom: I'm not waking u up anymore so what's ur plan to get up?

@TenaciousDbag @Pullsen I just watched it.....and idk what I just saw....

@Pullsen @TenaciousDbag I only looked at the thumb nail and thought "nope"

I wish I could go back to the moment when I gave my heart away.

RT @JesusIsAJerk: row row row your boat gently away from me

@lozwhitex I saw terry cruise at the gym. I did crunches w him just say "aaaaaabdominals". made my day.

Blocking isn't removing Lilly, when I say remove I mean so I don't have to b in pain whenever I see ur face.

Being dragged to some mental place tomorrow. Honestly I wouldn't mind a padded room and straight jacket.

@lozwhitex if u ever need to talk about anything don't b afraid to talk to me. U know I don't mind helping my friends.

@Pullsen ik. Me 2. When u can though. They aren't heavy though. More melodic. Ik u don't like heavy.

@Pullsen just check out on Xbox music. It's As I Lay Dying. One is in Frail Words Collapse Album and the other is in the

@Pullsen when this world fades does the most to me though. If u listen to it u will know what I mean.

@Pullsen the two songs I mentioned above have been for me. Just the lyrics and guitar move me.

@Pullsen it'll give u some insight on how I've been a little more too

I have learned some wise things from Tim Lambesis's writing. One reason I will always look up to him.

@Pullsen listen to it though seriously. Just for the lyrics. And When This World Fades. It'll hit ur feels.

The lyrics in The Darkest Nights fit how I have felt for the time I have felt like shit. The lyrics really do speak to me.

@lozwhitex I'm just gonna IM u on Skype what's wrong

Kill me pls. I hate living w this feeling.

I'm dying so bye

@Pullsen I get a lot of pain while dying inside rn. Emotion in physical form

As I predicted

@Pullsen probably gonna fail as I do in life w everything.

@TenaciousDbag im a person who doesn't do well w out it. I like relationships. but I always try to save thngs that r already dead.

@Pullsen no shes just not talking. last I tried was last Tuesday.

@Pullsen not since I told her I she wanted to ditch me she could but she kept me on everything

starting to accept the fact that u may have been just a summer romance and that no matter how hard I try we will never be the same

RT @SteveStfler: Everyone is in a relationship and I'm eating cookies.

@lozwhitex id go on an unfollow spree but I'm to lazy

@lozwhitex I'm following almost 500

@Pullsen exactly I'm hiding it my best

@Pullsen I've been carrying these thoughts w me forever

As mentally unstable as can be rn. But I'm not alone rn so can't do anything.

If u fake ur happiness people won't try to help you.

My sunglasses I'm wearing remind me of her. Why did I wear these today...

I await the day you forgive me and decide to speak to me again. :(

I think she'll like it http://t.co/dCcTdUq7Nn

I drew a lily for lily. Lol

I hate my dad, I hate my school, I hate everyone.

everyone telling me i'm selfish which is making me worse. this is what happens when I try to be open.

WTF I'VE APOLOGIZED FOR EVERYTHNG AND YOU STILL FORSAKE ME! I HOPE YOUR NOT SO SELFISH ABOUT UR BIRTHDAY THAT U DONT TALK TO ME AGAIN.

WTF IS WRONG W ME WOW

John:I'll take "Fucks Not Given" for 300

Yeah she's mad at me just as I thought. And I feel even worse about it.

I think I need help. Yesterday opened my eyes a little bit more. Yet I still feel as shitty as ever.

It's reassuring knowing I've effected one of my best friends' lives in a positive way. Maybe I do have some worth.

I bet I've influenced everyone negatively since I'm probably the most negative person ever.

I'm such a selfish asshole. Wow.

wondering how I have effected the lives of my friends and what I've done to deserve all of them.

oh great, I have to go to church today. at least I can ask for death there silently.

tears of sorrow drip from my broken soul, when this world fades away, I will see you again

had some fun playing TTT w @BLIZZARD_MaNiAC

God damn I miss her. :'(

Every time I see couples together I just wanna shoot myself honestly.

@Pullsen I am so fucking depressed rn that I have become physically ill. I'm gonna vomit.

I make myself sick. I feel like shit...

Sing an album then go to sleep. Every night I do this.

RT @SheoLovesCheese: I love you almost as much as I love cheese. /Almost/ #FlirtySheo

RT @Pullsen: Good night at the #BigE with @AlexScr34ms @BLIZZARD_MaNiAC and @RadBananaman 

So happy I didn't go crazy with food.

@OfficialVenix14 that's the one I went w. Edits the soundcloud name

Holy shit Tim's voice in Surrounded is so visceral sounding. Probably the  heaviest I've heard his voice ever I think.

@BroArmy_ listens to As I Lay Dying violently

@jwokmuzik @BLIZZARD_MaNiAC y don't u ask him

All u guys go follow @BLIZZARD_MaNiAC he's cool

@FizualMusic hey man I'd like to request an emblem

@NatalieNTM yay one option. I'm trying to come up w at least 5 usable aliases

I'm actually liking Elegy as an alias

@NatalieNTM DAMN I NEED AN ALIAS THOUGH. :(

@NatalieNTM shit I thought so. Lol

@OfficialVenix14 I'm brainstorming but I'm liking Solis, the Latin word for eclipse

@OfficialVenix14 I'm changing my alias to something I like before everything gets serious in music for me

I made this man look beautiful http://t.co/9ylJFgcO9a

@RekaVM never reminded u much cuz I didn't wanna bug u bout it.

@RekaVM may I has emblem sent to me

@lozwhitex I just read that welsh are actually the celts

@KrewellaJahan #soupypoopy is all I have to say lol

I AM PRO! I SURVIVED A PROP GUNT ROUND IN T POSE!!!! HOLY SHIT!

@lozwhitex omfg prop hunt is fun! I cant concentrate cuz I laugh to much while playin it though.

I can't feel my torso. It's all numb.

@holmes_markus haha yeh. hes hilarious. I love GassyMexican's impressions too. he has a good channel as well. Diction is funny too.

@holmes_markus as I like to call it, the "Nanners Edition" cuz of Seananners, my fav youtuber.

I'm gonna cut my ear off and prevent world war 2

@lozwhitex didn't guess I knew. Cuz it's u. Lol

I love this time of year cuz I can wear my Disturbed hoody.

@lozwhitex I accidentally called my teacher Lauren today. Haha

I for one enjoy company. I make time for everyone even if they met make time for me. Doesn't matter how far u r I still do.

@Pullsen u should know how tough it is for me to b empathetic to anyone cuz I don't usually feel much.

@Pullsen it's gonna b ok. Some things can't b fixed. If u need any support just ask.

U is for I'm ugly

BECAUSE I AM SO UG‚Ä¶

Apparently I look like Matt Damon in a few of my senior pics :|

A day late but  for National Tell a Girl She's Beautiful Day I say my gf Lilly is absolutely beautiful. Couldn't ask for any better :)

@lozwhitex I got caught. Lol. She took my phone for the period. She says I was being "disrespectful" by trying to take a pic.

@lozwhitex I can try. Her hair is lighter color than urs a little but has very similar face structure.

@lozwhitex I'm surprised I even remember that day

@lozwhitex lol. I think it was Mother's Day last year cuz I remember having to leave the call and Angie was in it.

@lozwhitex I still remember the first day I met u.

@lozwhitex I saw it and thought u would like it. Haha

This year I wanna reach fitness level Lambesis this year. Probably not gonna happen. xD

@lozwhitex I was gonna get a Toshiba but I wanna focus on gaming capabilities more. Asus is good. The one I'm getting is $350

@lozwhitex I'm gonna see I can buy an asus cuz they r good for gaming and powerful computers.

@lozwhitex the first time I saw it I was laughing so hard I was crying. Lol. May b getting laptop this weekend too btw :D

RT @JoeyTribbiiani: I just  

@lozwhitex yeh i love it too. Trying to get it for my laptop when I get it. As well as TTT, the hidden, and Suicide Survival

@Pullsen the DEVICE hat is a necessity for me. I NEED IT.

WH40K army is to small! This tourney has 1,750 point limit and I'm entering w a 919 point army! I'm so fucked if I can't get a good ally...

@holmes_markus i will def let u know when it's up. I will probably share it on twitter anyways too.

Gettin my laptop soon. Music and PC gaming here I come!

I DON'T WANNA GO BACK TO SCHOOL  

@numiiigoesrawrz I had te Feint page actually

@numiiigoesrawrz so do I. I only remember u and Lauren from it though

I think I've only ever vid chatted w @numiiigoesrawrz once. Lel

@ThatLeanPocket u too. And I don't want my gf scared away. Lel

If u could feel how I do rn

Me rn http://t.co/BPOIe2aauS

@Pullsen @evmiester98 @ThatLeanPocket I'm not

When I get really upset I just sit and listen to music for hours nonstop until I have to sleep.

@Pullsen well it was a giant bolt action gun. Obs I'm gonna b slower aiming and moving than u. And I needs to b more strategic.

@lozwhitex ah ok. Well maybe another day. I have Airsoft today too at 1 so idk if we could have. Good to have u back! :)

@Pullsen @evmiester98 @ThatLeanPocket plus I can't do cd mp cuz I no has hard drive

@Pullsen AMD MAINE ISN'T FAR. It's like 4 hours! Lol

@Pullsen yup. No not Lauren. Idk if she is around anymore even. Lol

@Pullsen YES DO IT. I'd have one today but I'm gonna b talking to Lilly again. Sorry I didn't play Xbox last night.

@Pullsen haha I hope not. Also do u think u can do Airsoft tomorrow? I want to play a game

Nvm I'm not blocked. It sent.

If u try sending someone a DM and it says "can't send (error: forbidden) does that mean I'm blocked?

@Pullsen thank god I thought I had another derp moment right there. Haha

@Pullsen no. Doesn't chivalry mean like politeness or kindness? That's what I thought.

Chivalry does get u places gentlemen! I proved it an never doubted it!

I'm gonna die of happiness rn. Lol

@ThatLeanPocket @Pullsen she cosplays too. I'm going w her to something in Boston this year as an Asassins Creed character. :)

@Pullsen good. Cuz I really like her and she really likes me. For once I'm not the only one who feels this way.

@Pullsen not really a fetish. Whatever. Who cares. I don't cuz I'm happy. Ur killing my vibe man.

@Pullsen yeh. Was goin for a selfie for my kik but joe an Lilly popped in and were just like "WAZZUP IT'S A CAMERA!"

@Pullsen yeah. And I can actually say for once that I'm taken. Haha

Much like Feint I am now homebound. (Bad music reference)

I'm gonna miss her. Good thing she goes to MA often! :)

Full Force by Ramses B is just fuckin beautiful. I'm in love w this track.

@lozwhitex I have a prettier one but I'll send it when I get back on Monday.

@lozwhitex I'm gonna try to take those pics tonight. Missed the sunset last night and would have been a really nice one.

What a tease for me! I'm so pumped!

@lozwhitex I apologize if I made tht precious conversation awkward in any way. Haha

"I DON'T PAY U MOTHERFUCKERS TO STAND AROUND DOIN NOTHIN"

@lozwhitex besides I'm probably single 4 life

@lozwhitex I always just think of trying things. I used to b really close minded and doubtful of alot of things and I missed out on lots.

@lozwhitex I like it better when I have a mental connection w someone. Those relationships last longer.

RT @VeryRudeTweets: I'm so ugly I can't even get my TV turned on.

Times like these on vacation make me wish I had a gf.

@ssweiit I will remember to say again on Sunday. :)

@ssweiit oh ok. I hope ur having a nice day anyways! Haha

RT @DangItObama: School is way too close... Thanks Obama.

Being at the ocean has kept An Ocean Between Us by As I Lay Dying stuck in my head for a few days now.

@LegitPenguin @ThatLeanPocket  I like heavy electronic music though. Cuz it reminds me of metal in a way.

I'm leaving Cape Cod tomorrow then I'm headed to Maine on Wednesday. Havin a  great time here!

I'm so stuffed. Had fried calamari w fries and then went to get cotton candy ice cream.

@numiiigoesrawrz idk. Probably not. He doesn't like me at all and I don't really consider him a friend

@numiiigoesrawrz let me guess. It has to do w birthdays am someone that I know.

@PullsenMoosic I'm gonna cut his fingers off I'm his sleep for this.

In so much pain. Brother chucked a tennis ball at my sensitive low region. :'(

@minecraft_tacco where is he though. I'm in  a part called Dennis at the cape

They have a sega genesis and a SNES here. I'm never leaving. Mario Kart forever for te rest of my life.

Told that my voice sound like a girl voice AGAIN. I hate my voice so much. My 13 yr old sister had a deeper voice than me for Christ sake!

@NatalieNTM I have evry album and song they have ever done. Device is just as amazing too. David Draiman sings for them :3

The song by Disturbed that gives me the most feels is Sickened. But all the songs do. I'm a hardcore Disturbed One. Always will be!

@lozwhitex Internet friends is probably my most favorite one too. Power Glove is another one of my faves.

@lozwhitex yes it is amazing. I love knife party. What was ur favorite on this EP?

I'm going bye bye nao. Bye y'all.

Gotta say I'm gonna miss working. Worked w some nice people. Definitely gonna work here again next summer. :)

@lozwhitex I'm freeeeee

Last day of work tomorrow. Leaving Saturday and I won't b back til the 24th or 25th. Ill tweet but less cuz I'm goin off of 3G. No wifi :(

U r all helpless against my strength. Oh god I love Crackdown... :')

What r u little gang members gonna do? I'm a fuckin super agent! I'm throwing fuckin cars at u! xD

My laptop works again so I'm able to Skype again. Yay

Y don't I just publish this shit?! I could sell songs to artists.

I've showe some people my lyrics I've written before from alot of songs I've written and they say its all really good and I had talent.

@DeezyDubstep @BathrobeofDeath @PrismoMusic I don't have my laptop and equipment yet but soon

@DeezyDubstep @BathrobeofDeath @PrismoMusic oh. Ok. If u throw me a title I could write a lyric line for u and we what I can do.

@BathrobeofDeath @DeezyDubstep @PrismoMusic and I'm pretty sure u don't need that.

@BathrobeofDeath @DeezyDubstep @PrismoMusic depends on the style. I need vocal lessons to make my self better but I can do metal singing rn

@ThatLeanPocket does it? I haven't seen much if it.

@ThatLeanPocket I don't like political parties. I prefer independent. Less sources of corruption.

@PullsenMoosic I want the Booty

@PullsenMoosic yeah. I will try. I want it. I want all the merch.

@PullsenMoosic yeh. I just need a different battery. Current one is shitting out on me.

@PullsenMoosic I have a good auto already too though.

Possibly ordering my Barrett .50 Airsoft sniper today. Getting snake and laptop after I get bak from vaca.

@PullsenMoosic I will buy ALL the merch! Lol. Btw gonna try to order my gun today so I have it for my party.

@NatalieNTM forgot to list Anger and Apathy by As I Lay Dying. It's  one of my faves :)

Electronic I good too but not my main thing I listen to.

I love metal. Hence my @ name. That and I do metal screaming often. Haha

@NatalieNTM if u like within temptation u may like Lacuna Coil too. I love them :3

@NatalieNTM really? I love metal! I think Forsaken, The Sound of Truth, and An Ocean Between Us by As I Lay Dying.

@Spagoote I was screaming for 50 minutes straight earlier so my voice is strained. And ik I sound young. Lol

I will see how I am in a month. I think I found a good hobby. Haha!

Pretty satisfied w my progress over the past few months since I started being more fit. I can see the difference now.

I have definition but no added mass. :(

Where did all this confidence come from? I feel like I could knock out a Russian bear trained by Chuck Norris!

Promise myself I wouldn't overdo it today. And what do I do...

@SuperBruce23 I heard it cuz my friend had it an I'd heard it was very good. I like it. Very lyrical.

@knowthyselfie thank u ;) (I have no idea who ur referring to)

@sariskagiraffe u don't know half of it sweetheart. I have 8 spiders on just one wall in my room. There r more than 8 in my room too!

#sadgooglesearches why am I forever alone?

Last gym day for the week. I'm gonna b sore if I go again.

@SuperBruce23 I liked his whole new album. I dot usually listen to rap or hip hop. Usually electronic or metal.

@sariskagiraffe oh sorry that's me. Ill just get out of ur way

‚Äú@CeIebMemes: Obama http://t.co/gmPtZKP6BG‚Äù Oh snap it's about to go down

@PullsenMoosic no. I was just posting funny pics.

And this is who is ur Internet guide is http://t.co/kcF1AnLm56

@lozwhitex thank u. I think it make me look 5 though. No wonder people think I'm a freshman. Haha

@lozwhitex what do u think of my avi? idk if I like my avi or not.

These people think I'm a girl. Damn u squeaky voice and Xbox mic.

@AmRainbowDash oh. Well that's good. In that case just think she is next to u I guess. Then u won't feel alone or upset.

@AmRainbowDash ok. Convince urself that u don't need her. It's how I get over stuff like that. Before I know it I'm back to normal! :)

I think my header looks nice w my new avi

@PullsenMoosic I'm gonna love my expensive non temp tattoo.

So I look 5 years old to everyone. That's fine w me. Ill still look fresh while all y'all r wrinkly and saggy an old looking :P

@Spagoote I'm actually 17

@Spagoote oh I get it now. Haha! No I'm just immortalZ

I have a sexy work out pal. U should all b jelly. Lol

@PullsenMoosic no. I've always been told I look younger. Regardless of lighting. All my coworkers thought I was a freshman.

So many girls in yoga pants I was surrounded by. I was on the bicep curlers and there were 4 girls on the surrounding gear.

Idk if I like this. Oh well .__. http://t.co/dFrr5bf63o

@PullsenMoosic me too. Kinda weird how I had a dream someone was in an accident earlier this week.

@PullsenMoosic I will. He's on his way to hospital rn. Some other kid was driving. As reckless as jay is, jay is good driver

My friend was in a car accident. I hope he's ok :(

10 more followers until I hit 200.

The poem in the middle of the bridge in Anger and Apathy hits me in the feels every time. I love this song more than most people.

I wanna make a Tim Lambesis page but I feel it'd b disrespectful to him cuz it would b named Lim Tambesis.

@PullsenMoosic I greet my friends by saying 'fuck u'

Oops. It's actually Aries by Unearthed. Spelled title wrong. :)

@PullsenMoosic johns r hideous creatures that r little known of. It's said they crawled out of the abyss 2 million years ago. That's all we

@PullsenMoosic I'm gonna warn u before its to late, don't go full Evan on this. Ur close to Evan level insanity w this John thing.

Almost lunch break. Skype IM anyone?

I need an alias change. Really gotta think about this.

@PullsenMoosic y did u have to say that. Now I wanna change it cuz I feel I'm copying and it not original.

@PullsenMoosic I can't wait to show u my emblem. It's sick.

@lozwhitex I probably like blue or blueish gray the most.

@lozwhitex haha. Well I don't. Te only thing I can't really remember was ur fav color. It was either yellow or orange I think. Lol

@lozwhitex I'd travel for awesome landscape photos. And of course I remember. I listen actually. Haha

@lozwhitex there are alot of newspaper and news stations where I live too. Idk if it'd b exactly studying abroad though. Haha

@lozwhitex woah Egypt? Idk if I'd go there cuz if what going on there rn. And u might go abroad for journalism someday

@lozwhitex :( I would if I could

@PullsenMoosic hah. I don't know what to think of tht.

@PullsenMoosic yay it is. I will try to get it before summers end :)

@PullsenMoosic cuz u know I love the vector. My signature automatic

@PullsenMoosic KWA KRISS Vector Gas Blowback for $380.

@PullsenMoosic ik. Ill consider lessons.

@PullsenMoosic yeah but I'm screaming. Lol. Mostly. I don't know y I try to start a band

@PullsenMoosic yeah. Ill work on vocals for now. All I need is my mic and I can focus on PC gaming for a bit too.

Now that I think about it I may just give up on producing cuz I'm just gonna get criticism from Alex and other haters.

@PullsenMoosic see? I'm never sure cuz he's always so sarcastic

@Spagoote I meant when the deed is done.

@NatalieNTM I find the harshest jokes funny sometimes.

@Spagoote @PullsenMoosic I has dead space 2. Haven't played in a while on mp. Used to b highest rank and skilled. :P

@Spagoote I'm bad at spelling. :'(

@ThatLeanPocket I'm making mysel look dumb trying to prove a point anyways

@ThatLeanPocket the point is I'm not complaining. Just drop it ok.

@ThatLeanPocket I'm not. I'm just stating my thoughts. Y r u complaining to me?

I feel like nobody wants to talk to me on twitter anymore. Even my good friends. All I get r favorites and retweets all the time mostly now.

@NatalieNTM aha! I see what ya did there. Lol. Anti jokes....

@AmRainbowDash if u get upset again just look at that link I sent. Lol

@AmRainbowDash if u want any advice I can give u some

@AmRainbowDash np. Anytime. Hate when friends r upset. I went through what u r so I can relate. I just broke the cycle of depression

I can hear how the somg Whispering Silence and the rest of the Awakened album relate to the events in Tim's life at te time. Kinda sad tbh.

Last week of work then I'm on vacation for the rest of the summer. I can finally talk to my friends and chill more. :)

@Imany_12 ok. Just making sure cuz some religious people r just like 'satanist!' To atheists.

@Imany_12 I know an atheist and she i like my best friend and is the nicest person in the world.

@Imany_12 don't b. it's fine. It's better to not have an external influence like religion on me honestly.

@Imany_12 me and the divine have never mixed well. I'll leave it at that.

@Imany_12 I could pray 24/7 and have nothing reassure me that anything is ok in life.

@Imany_12 that's just my thoughts on it honestly. Cuz to me it seems God just doesn't care about some people.

@Imany_12 I keep my mind open.  I've been through stages of suicidal tendencies at the worst and not given a care about God. Lol

@Imany_12 so I can't really call myself a Christian.

@Imany_12 ok. I'm not very religious. But I believe in most of Christianity. I think god guided evolution. But my faith is shaken constantly

@Imany_12 r u highly religious

@Imany_12 it doesn't matter we r all gonna burn

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket let's leave it at this http://t.co/xkYRA7qXdH

@ThatLeanPocket @Imany_12 war is just basically extreme sibling rivalry

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket it won't stop until the end of the human race. But our nature to survive at all costs will no doubt prevent it.

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket humans r stupid and hopelessly arrogant, and unreasonable. There will always b evil in the world.

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket it's a civil war. What  do u expect honestly

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket have u seen what the Syrians have been doing?

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket they r not doing terrible things! That's Hamas propaganda

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket @ReelNoize y not? It's a safe haven for alot of religions but the Palestinians can't get over an age old conflict

@Imany_12 @ThatLeanPocket @ReelNoize yes. I heart Israel

@ThatLeanPocket @ReelNoize ik. Israel is a good ally. I love Israel.

@ReelNoize @ThatLeanPocket u were talking about muslims and some people thinkin we can blow up anyone. I remember.

@ReelNoize @ThatLeanPocket I'm just pointing out that we use alot of precision munition to reduce collat damage is all.

@ReelNoize I'm not. And respect to ur dad. I'm just saying I know alot about military things

@ThatLeanPocket @ReelNoize that was years ago. I'm talking about munitions like the Moab (massive ordnance air burst). It's not a mini Nuke.

@ReelNoize trust me. Anything military I know.

@ThatLeanPocket it's the innocents being blamed for the the extremists actions. It's sad really.

Saw a tiny plane in the sky and heard voice I'm my head say "enemy UAV spotted"

@lozwhitex haha! I remember that. Video games help too I guess. Lol

@lozwhitex maybe. I get like tht when I'm tired. U should get some sleep. Maybe u will feel better.

@lozwhitex I woke up just like 'holy shit don't b real'. Aha

@coliri_nmh lol. I had no idea how to say anything. So just 'uh'

I always wake up at the turn of the hour. I woke up at 10:59.

@AmRainbowDash find something to fill the space. Hang out w u fiends if that helps too. I went through this last year.

Idk the truth but I'm willing to wait until his trial is done.

This could have possibly set the scene for a possible set up I'm which Tim could have ALOT of trouble getting out of.

Those who wish to know the truth shouldn't forsake him so quickly. If u want to know the truth b patient for Christ sake!

RT @ThatLeanPocket: God I forgot how good no fire is

Id like to wish @TimLambesisJail the best of luck in his trial in September. I look forward to hearing the truth about this situation.

Fuck missed my 6k! Oh well. 6,005 goes to a big source of my inspiration, the legendary @DAVIDMDRAIMAN and Tim Lambesis of @ASILAYDYINGBAND

Oops. Sorry if I spoiled some of iron man 3 for some people if u haven't seen it.

@lozwhitex I knew she didn't cuz I was like "oh shit what now!" Then I remembered she was injected and it was "beast mode activated" xD

@lozwhitex iron man 3 i should have said. Have u seen it? It's so good .

@lozwhitex have u seen the new iron man? I loved it. Pepper gets bass ass powers

@lozwhitex @ThatLeanPocket he's a good actor. One of my favorites I gotta say.

I stopped listening to them for a little cuz I was disappointed about Tim being arrested.

Been goin on a huge AILD listening spree lately.

@ThatLeanPocket that ones pretty good too. I haven't listens I them in a while. Cuz I went hardcore for a while. Still am. Lol

@ThatLeanPocket true. I think it's cuz they have alot of electronic influence and the singer has good vocals an rarely does screaming.

@PullsenMoosic I do to. I'm keeping 50 bucks at the ready

@lozwhitex I need a good one myself. Lol. Sorry if u just got spamme btw. My phone glitched up w sending.

@ThatLeanPocket I'm tryin to keep my budget for laptop at 350-400

@ThatLeanPocket ok good tip. I'm getting it for music only not gaming. I'm sspsneding like 270 on DJ/producing equipment too though.

@PullsenMoosic @Digidom_ good. Ill check him out.

I like metal but honestly it's not something to listen to when ur feeling down or out of it.

@Digidom_ @PullsenMoosic Eminence, Seven Lions and Mitis are others I listen to to chill out. I need new ones though

@Digidom_ @PullsenMoosic ik about Ramses B. I listen to him w Feint usually.

I need suggestions for happy sounding electronic music like House or Trance.

@LaBrush41 well so do I. I love screaming and singing it even more though. I'm a huge metal guy.

@LaBrush41 y u want a voice like that? It's not really accepted still in te music world so much.

@LaBrush41 cough cough I have one cough cough

Left my phone in the car and it got so hot it said I couldn't use it until it cooled off!  Burned my fuckin hands too!

Listening to comedy on break rn. I need to laugh.

@dannybwoi49 @lozwhitex my laptop broke so it doesn't charge so whenever we talk again I have to use my phone Skype app. Sorry guys.

RT @dannybwoi49: Lol I wonder if saying RT for an indirect would work... RT FOR AN INDIRECT! :D

My brain was all "fuck sleep" so now I'm still tired. But I get to work OUTSIDE today rather than in a humid 6 floor building! Yes!

Someone nag me so I fall asleep easier and faster.

@LP3X I have to talk later cuz I have to go to work.
