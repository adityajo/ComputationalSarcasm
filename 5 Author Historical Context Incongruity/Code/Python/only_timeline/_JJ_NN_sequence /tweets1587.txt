The good: Carolina ran it 21 times for 87 yards against the best run D in the NFL.

The bad: two turnovers and two rookies burned for TDs

Oh, okay.  Seeing replay for first time.  Doesn't look like clean INT by Thomas.

Can goes right at Sherman again and very nearly hit Kelvin for a 35 yard TD

Seattle's two TDs have come at the expense of two Carolina rookies in the secondary- Tre Boston (UNC) and Bene Benwikere.

Wilson to Kearse for 63 yds is longest TD pass in SEA postseason history.  14-7 Seattle leads, 454 til half.

@BloggerSoDear I get the concept of comparing losses of the 1 loss teams. But TCU'S loss...was to Baylor.  H2H, Baylor is proven better team

Per USA Today's Jeff Sagarin's SOS rankings...

CFP committee will reveal final rankings and all-important top 4 today at 12:30.  ACC bowl bids will be announced today at 5:30 on ACCDN.

@WBALDash I wish she would.  Santa is going to have to get a part time job at Sonic.

It's official  Starmount will play 14-1 Wallace-Rose Hill Friday, December 12th in Raleigh in the 1AA State Finals.

Starmount defensive TD being ruled a fumble officially.  Backwards pass.  Either way, jumped route, and TD for home team.

A rare Starmount pass results in an easy 30 yard TD.  14-0 Rams lead Swain Co, 1120 til half.

Two plays...two long runs, capped off by a 29 yard scamper.  TD Starmount.  This place is electric.  7-0 the score, 933 in 1st.

Starmount's last fb state title was 16 years ago.  They were 1A then. http://t.co/E569VDWbw6

Starmount is one win from the 1AA state championship game.  Rams host Swain Co. at 730. http://t.co/GtOkDcixO4

Shy Tuttle and Jalen Dalton will both play for Steve Mariucci on the Armour/Black team in the UA All-American game.  http://t.co/HDuDEGbOOa

@SDW_2 you should just start pulling up from there...with, like 13 seconds left on the shot clock in the middle of the 1st quarter.

@IAmRobWuFox26 good point.  either way, I would not be at all surprised if there's a new HC in DC next season.

Gotta love #sources.  WaPo reporting Gruden wants RGIII outta D.C.  Schefter reporting RGIII could get his job back soon.

Easter Friday!  Reagan QB Jake accounts for 6 TDs (5 passing, 1 rushing) in Reagan's 48-24 win over North Davidson.  Raiders now in 4A qtrs.

Last 3rd from Pfafftown, Reagan still leads ND by 10, 34-24.

What...a...game.  39 yard TD pass for North.  Black Knights pull to within 10, 27-17, 30.5 ticks til half.

First ND pass play is picked by Reagan.  Raiders ball at ND 20, 201 til half.

The 2014 Duke football team is doing its best 2001 Duke football team impression right now- down 28-7 to UNC early in the 2nd qtr.

Both of Triad's no. 1 seeds (E.Forsyth, S.Guilford) advance.  Reagan hosts N.Davidson next week, and E.Surry, Mt.Airy &amp; W.Forsyth all lose

East Forsyth, Reagan, N.Davidson, HP Central, Tabor, N.Guilford, Asheboro, S.Guilford, E.Alamance, W.Stokes, Carver &amp;  Starmount all advance

Tough night on the hsfb gridiron as NW Guilford, W.Forsyth, SE Guilford, Page, Davie, E. Guilford, Ledford, W.Alamance, &amp; Williams all lose

Regan wins its first playoff game in school history, 50-42 over A.L. Brown.  The Raiders host North Davidson in the 2nd round.

Reagan pulling away in the 4th against Brown. We're just a few minutes from clinching a rematch between N.Davidson and the Raiders next week

Danny Manning...UNDEFEATED ALL TIME in his Wake Forest career!  Deacs win their regular season opener, 80-69 over UNC-Asheville.

Deacs start two freshmen and three juniors for the season opener.

@BloggerSoDear perhaps the most intriguing guy on the team.

@WBALDash looks like the weight he has gained/lost will really benefit him in March.

Dinos is a little bit of a surprise, imo...but Manning has downplayed importance of starters for weeks.

Pure speculation, but wondering if lengthy debate by NCHSAA over Dudley ban (2.5 hrs now) bodes well for Panthers and state fb playoffs....

Per the NCHSAA, Dudley's 2nd appeal will be heard at 9 a.m. Thursday.

Dudley school reps are speaking with media now...team coverage begins today at 5 on @WXII

Per a release, Dudley is now appealing its denied appeal to the full NCHSAA board.  If 2nd appeal is unsuccessful, fb season is truly over.

Heartbreak in Greensboro.  Dudley's appeal has been denied.  4A football champs will NOT be allowed to defend their title.  Season is over.

Nice bounce-back win for North Davidson, at home, over West Forsyth, 16-14.  Knights finish 2nd in the CPC.

Wake catches a break!  Clemson muffs the punt and the Deacs recover at the Tiger 13.  1st down.

Nice return out to the 37.  Deacs will start from there, leading 7-3.  8:42 til half.

Big stop by Deacs' D.  Clemson hits 28 yd FG.  Wake still leads 7-3.

3 straight runs for Wake...loss of 5 total...Deacs to punt.

End of 1...Wake 7 Clemson 0.  Deacs were 21 point underdogs an hour ago.

With 30 yards rushing so far in the first quarter, the Deacs have nearly already hit their per-game average on the ground.

Wortham gets the carry on another 3rd and long and converts.  Wake running game showing signs of life.  1st and goal Deacs.

"Deshaun, get loose.  You're in next series"

-Dabo, I have to assume.

Wortham huge run for 20 on a gutsy 3rd and 10 draw call.  Deacs out past their own 40 now.

Wolford sacked.  Deacs will punt from midfield.

Wolford is 2-2 converting 3rd downs on this drive and the Deacs have moved into Clemson territory.  Good opening drive for young offense.

Wake had a bye this weekend and is preparing to host no. 21 Clemson Thursday night.  At 2-6, the Deacs must win out to be bowl-eligible.

UNC fell at Miami 40-27 and is now allowing 41.9 PPG- 4th worst in DI.  They must win 2 of last 3 (vs Pitt, at Duke, vs NC St) to go to bowl

Dave Doeren won his first ACC game at NC State (in his 13th try) as the Pack won at 'Cuse, 24-17.  State now one win from bowl-eligibility.

In-state, biggest story was no. 23 ECU losing at Temple, 20-10.  No. 24 Duke won at Pitt in 2OT.  Duke now 7-1, alone in 1st in ACC coastal.

North Davidson absolutely has the talent and playmakers to get back in this...but they need to show some life, soon.

Bad to worse for North davidson.  Pass is picked off by reagan and run back to ND 12.

Lone bright spot for Carolina is Jerricho Cotchery (4 for 75).  They were good on 3rd down, offensively (5-6) but dreadful on D (1 for 6)

DeAngelo's hurt, Steve Smith has 100+ yards and 2 TDs, they're down 14 and it's not yet halftime.  Other than that, good start for Panthers.

Per his head coach at West Forsyth, Jalen Dalton's decision will come later rather than sooner.  He is planning two or three official visits

And, of course, if Jalen Dalton picks VT or Miami, he would be the latest in a long line of top in-state prospects to leave NC for college.

If Jalen Dalton does choose Virginia Tech, he would join another Triad defensive star, No. Guilford CB Mook Reynolds, as a VT commit.

Jalen Dalton has previously listed his top 3 as UNC, Virginia Tech, and Miami and said he planned to announce in late Sept. or early Oct.

Jalen Dalton is a defensive end from West Forsyth, 4-star recruit, the no. 3 overall player in NC.

With Shy Tuttle picking Tennessee, Reggie Gallaspy going w/NC State, and Juval Mollette signing w/UNC, attention now turns to Jalen Dalton.

Rough day in the ACC as UNC, NC State, Duke, and Wake all fall.  GT and FSU are the league's only unbeaten teams.

Carolina's first two turnovers of the season tonight have both led to Pittsburgh TDs.  Panthers trail by 17 with 11 minutes to play.

Special teams have been costly for Carolina tonight.  Don't forget about the FG encroachment penalty that cost them, essentially, 4 points

Olsen, 37 yard TD strike from Cam.  Life here at the Bank, but still work to be done.  23-13, Carolina trails Pittsburgh with 13:28 to play.

Derek Anderson running, getting loose, throwing.  I don't see Cam yet but DA is moving with sense of urgency not typically seen from backup.

on replay, DeCastro then held up his hands like "what?"

Steelers fans can thank David DeCastro for that momentum killing, idiotic personal foul on the reigning defensive player of the year.

D.A. was warming up a moment ago...but no more.
