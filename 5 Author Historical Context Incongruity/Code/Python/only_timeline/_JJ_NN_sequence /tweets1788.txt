@DaveHeathy ooh really! which part are you going to?

@DaveHeathy have you booked to go?!

@bennypring11 guiltyyy ☺️👊💁

@bennypring11 @DaveHeathy road rage Central

@bennypring11 @DaveHeathy haha would love to see you drive around London 😂✖️🚨🌃

@bennypring11 @DaveHeathy Ben we are going on the 18th!!!!!

@DaveHeathy that's okay 😊😊 also because the lion king is popular with family's and children I would go in the evening not the avo ☺️

@DaveHeathy oh and it's an open ticket as well!

@DaveHeathy this time we are going 1st through ticket tree instead

@DaveHeathy did it separately because of rail cards, we shouldn't have though wasn't cheaper, on tickettree 1st if like £97 for two people😊

@DaveHeathy @bennypring11 it's really good isn't it!! you still get a good view there and for cheaper than the stalls! hahaha true😂😂

@DaveHeathy musical pro now!😉😂 ah yeah we will be there then! yeah I'm so excited... Ben isn't so much 😂 @bennypring11

@DaveHeathy first option 😊 http://t.co/OOC7QDckTz

@DaveHeathy he was screaming, stamping, clapping, shouting and touching our legs 😂😂 so they left😂we are watching CATS on the 18th of April 😃

@DaveHeathy we were in the royal circle, go on the lion king website, it let's you see the view you will have from your exact seats 😊

@DaveHeathy me and Ben want to watch it again, a little child ruined the whole first half for us 😂👊😟 typical! oh and we were late again!😂

@DaveHeathy heeeey! go on tickettree online it's the best! you book your show, hotel and then the rail if you want, in the same booking👌☺️x
