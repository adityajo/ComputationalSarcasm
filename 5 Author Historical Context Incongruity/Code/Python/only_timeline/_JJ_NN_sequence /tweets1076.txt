Feel like the walking dead thIs morning & with facials all morning no doubt i'll be comatose by lunch time. Sleep deprivation is no fun!

Eugh!! Sleep deprivation &amp; the start of a cold isn&#39;t a great combination. Feel rubbish!

Sleepy girl tonight, think it'll be straight to bed after the rugby as i'm up bright & early for work in the morning.

Sleepy princess tonight, so I'm heading to bed. Fingers crossed I'll actually manage a full night
