A fairly unflattering picture of me earlier at @HarbourLightsPH, where the screen doors to look like the #TARDIS http://t.co/ri793MCqT3

@OceanicBlue that would be great, our American department manager has described our department as a TARDIS, I'm assuming she's a whovian ;-)

Debating if I should put my 'I helped fly the TARDIS' certificate in my professional portfolio....:-P

@meegat @ElbowsMcGee thank you, got engaged in Ten's TARDIS console at the Experience, which was awesome! :-)

@the_knights87 thank you. That means a lot to me. TARDIS console room seemed the appropriate place :-) :-)

Reading a Neil Gaiman book on my tablet, resplendent in its #TARDIS blue cover, only a hour away from‚Ä¶ http://t.co/6iC7yMcqgG

@TARDIS_Tweet Big badda boom! ;) #TARDISTweets

I'll be co-hosting a Doctor Who tweet-along with @TARDIS_Tweet and 'Battlefield' today at 2000GMT. #TARDISTweets

RT @ChrisWatt4: RT @TARDIS_Tweet: Join Ace,The Doctor &amp; the Brig Tomorrow for an Excalibur mystery. Battlefield; doors open 19:45 #T ...

@the_knights87 Its comical. I used to use the audio as an alarm clock, lol #TARDISTweets

Love the Doctor jumping in that scene :-) #TARDISTweets

#TARDISTweets

@the_knights87 Exactly. lol #TARDISTweets

"Code brown?" Erm, you don't want to know what that means in Nurse speak :-S #TARDISTweet

Such a strong performance from Patrick in this scene #TARDISTweets

Surely we must be coming up to triple figures on how many times Packer's name has been uttered? #TARDISTweets

I had to take a photo of the steps outside of St Pauls last year when I visited London :-) #TARDISTweets

That Cyberman sounds like he has a sore throat #TARDISTweets

@DaftPhully Its is, very much like the racism in Tomb of the Cybermen #TARDISTweets

Vaughn's crazy eyebrow is outta control! #TARDISTweets

@DaftPhully "you......MAN!" Gotta laugh at that retort! #TARDISTweets

Sexism is rife in this era, its almost a shock to hear it #TARDISTweets

RT @the_knights87: Crazy Cybermen love walking in the sewers  #TARDIStweets

Here comes the cyberman I want for my Birthday! #CrazyInTheCoconut #TARDISTweets

@the_knights87 @TARDIS_Tweet I want one for my Birthday, particularity the crazy one. lol #TARDISTweet

Vaughn,I think you should ask for your money back on those target practice sessions you put your henchmen on #TARDISTweets

@the_knights87 That is the drawback of animation. I do think Zoe looks too old in the animations as well #TARDISTweets

uh oh, Packer has angered Vaughn's freaky eyebrows #TARDISTweets

The writing on the side of the liftshaft "Kilroy was here!" was written by @WhoFrazer #TARDISTweets

@TARDIS_Tweet @the_knights87 actually, it looks like a bit of a comb over job as well. lol #TARDISTweets

Packer tipping, what fun! #TARDISTweets

RT @DaftPhully: Vaughn would do well as a "Shark Tank" investor. #TARDIStweets

Love the sinister undertones in The Doctors voice, Patrick should have done much more voice over work with that awesome voice #TARDISTweets

Love the way Vaughn describes Packer like a disobedient vicious dog #TARDISTweets

Packer is rather smarmy. He would have made an awesome pantomime villain #TARDISTweets

@Shelly_Gage Benton boy is slacking in this episode #TARDISTweets

"PACKER?" All Vaughn needs is a fluffy cat to stroke and he's all set as an Uber villian #TARDISTweets

@the_knights87 So do I, keeps you guessing until the final reveal #TARDISTweets

unfortunately a lot of the locations in this story no longer exist. :-( #TARDISTweets

Jamie is rather stroppy in this episode #TARDISTweets

@the_knights87 he dropped out of charm school, thats for sure. lol #TARDISTweets

Go for it Zoe, trash the computer! #TARDISTweets

@the_knights87 so do I :-( #TARDISTweets

RT @the_knights87: I wish Nicholas Coutrney and Liz Sladen were alive for the 50th : ( #TARDIStweets

Meet the new Brig!!! That 'tashe is sooooo fake :-) #TARDISTweets

Time for some Jolly UNIT action! #TARDISTweets

You can see how damaged some of the surviving tapes are in the outdoor filming. #TARDISTweets

RT @the_knights87: @DaftPhully He was in the Prisoner also and I think The Avengers also an Emma Peel one  #TARDIStweets

Lost count of how many times Packer's name has been mentioned already! #TARDISTweets

RT @Shelly_Gage: C'mon Doctor. Just press 0 and keep pressing it until a human comes on. Or pretend you have a rotary phone. #TARDISTweets

@DameRoger perhaps it's to stop herself falling over, although that clearly doesn't work #TARDIStweets

@paul_bowler health and safety would have a field day with that now! ;-) #TARDIStweets

"This senseless evil killing" powerfully put, Mr Hartnell #TARDIStweets

Love the way he's fallen....down a tiny gap #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger probably, she's probably wondering where her stiletto heels and cat suit went as well...#TARDIStweets

The Doctor clearly fancies himself as a rock star, Trashing the place like that #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger perhaps he stopped of at the Tourist Information centre first X-D #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger just hearing the audio gives me the creeps. Such a shame we only have the audio #TARDIStweets

Start of episode 6 #TARDIStweets

Ok, who let the bath plug out? #TARDISTweets

@paul_bowler I think they were more creepy in the older stories than now as the lack of SFX makes it more realistic #TARDIStweets

#TARDIStweets

Everyone makes a big deal about the eye stalk view recently perhaps they need to watch this story to see its always been there #TARDIStweets

Was that surprise, pain or just bad acting, Mr Dalek? #TARDIStweets

The Thaals have a good point, perhaps we shall mutter the same words one day #TARDIStweets

The Doctor doesn't do a very good Mr Burns; Chesterton eh? #TARDIStweets

Start of episode 5 #TARDIStweets

Nice bit of anticipation at the end of that episode #TARDIStweets

@Andy_Gage it's a bit of a hobby for him now #TARDIStweets

"I don't intend to die anywhere" that be fighting talk, Ian! #TARDIStweets

"Smells like an old goat farm" Welcome to London Susan. Lol #TARDIStweets

Jenny is a cheerful soul #TARDIStweets

Love the headless dude #TARDIStweets

I love how spontaneous Susan is, and so desperately lost #TARDIStweets

Dalek tipping- should be turned into a sport. Lol #TARDIStweets

The Ikea lamp of doom #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 couldn't resist. Lol #TARDIStweets

That's a bad Dalek disco #TARDIStweets

That Dalek has a limp plunger. Lol #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 @BlewsAttack it's interesting to see how society's views of what is appropriate has evolved over the years #TARDIStweets

@BlewsAttack the era itself is rather sexist #TARDIStweets

The Daleks are rather sexist #TARDIStweets

Love the way that Dalek keeps moving back and forth urgently, perhaps it needs the bathroom? #TARDIStweets

Is it just me, or does one of those Daleks sound a little like K-9? #TARDIStweets

@ElbowsMcGee unfortunately notüòùüòùüòù ‚ù§#TARDIStweets

"What the devil...." What a wonderful phrase so underused nowadays. #TARDIStweets

Ian isn't being very adventurous #TARDIStweets

Love the photocopied landmarks on set. #TARDIStweets

Love the incidental music. Simple yet effective to build tension #TARDIStweets

This is the first story to have feature a quarry #TARDIStweets

@BlewsAttack indeed. #TARDIStweets

This scene proves what a awesome actor William Hartnell was. #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 @Shelly_Gage and competition from Sarah Jane #TARDIStweets

Susan, that was a terrible fall. Lol #TARDIStweets

Well, Dexter is stuffed if he wants to dump bodies in that river #TARDIStweets

That looks like a stag do gone wrong #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 that's good timing #TARDIStweets

Love the little scene before the opening credits #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 to dude! :-) #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet not bad thank you, looking forward to this iconic story #TARDIStweets

@DWfan9 hello! #TARDIStweets

@Shelly_Gage ooh lovely. I think you have the nicer beverage! #TARDIStweets

@Shelly_Gage @BlewsAttack I'm on my third cup already! :-) #TARDIStweets

@Sock_Monkey_Who yeah, Quarks are cute and deadly! #QuarksForever #quarksMakeEverythingOk #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet good evening #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet thanks for an awesome session! #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger I agree #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 I so need that as a cat name! #TARDIStweets

Francis Barber was BORN to play this role #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet what an awesome first word! #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger they must have a faulty batch! #TARDIStweets

"I blew them up with love" love conquers all folks! :-) #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 perhaps the Cybermen may get a couple of coupons for their trouble. Lol #TARDIStweets

Really hope the new Cybermen are less Stompy #TARDIStweets

@Shelly_Gage absolutely. I want one, and a Quark! #TARDIStweets #QuarksForever

@TARDIS_Tweet and ironic! #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 I don't need a Kinda Box to be silly. Lol #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 hope he doesn't know the Kinda and has box. Lol #TARDIStweets

Such a cute and poignant moment. " save the tears for later boyo" #TARDIStweets

"Oh that's cute" No Craig, it's a lean mean killing machine! #TARDIStweets

Haha, Craig, you're so funny #TARDIStweets

I could see distinct effort from both of them trying not to laugh in that scene #TARDIStweets

RT @the_knights87: A Star Trek teleport.  Thats classic  #TARDISTweets

@Shelly_Gage @SockMonkeyWho agreed! #TARDIStweets

I really like the design of these Cybermats #TARDIStweets

@Shelly_Gage can imagine the Doctor being Willy Wonka! #TARDIStweets

@Shelly_Gage can imagine them sharing a pint or two #TARDIStweets

Love the way the Doctor talks to kids like adults, fun, respectful and just awesome! #TARDIStweets

I wonder how many takes it took to get the baby to cry/be quiet on cue? #TARDIStweets

Love the rapport throughout this episode, you can tell Matt and James are good friends #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger absolutely! No-one can beat the mighty Trout! :-) #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet a wonderful tribute! :-) #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 I would have loved that #TARDIStweets

RT @DameRoger: Brilliant little Pat Troughton call-out there. Nice moment. #TARDISTweets

Ah! A Second Doctor reference!!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 #TARDIStweets

Half expecting the Ninth Doctor to appear in this opening scene with the department store #TARDIStweets

RT @BlewsAttack: @TARDIS_Tweet @cheezypeas Well the kid does very much resemble someone we are about to get to know very well so maybe w ...

@TARDIS_Tweet that would be funny! #TARDIStweets

@Sock_Monkey_Who @TheCricketingDr there should be a Quark Protection Society Poor things! #TARDIStweets #QuarksAreForLifeNotJustForChristmas

@TARDIS_Tweet I wonder if we will see Stormageddon in future episodes? #TARDIStweets

@Sock_Monkey_Who perhaps he becomes a Quark? #quarksMakeEverythingOk  #QuarksAreCool #QuarksForever #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet evening! :-) #TARDIStweets

A snake? Pretty bloody apt at the moment. #TARDIStweets

RT @the_knights87: Tegan proves Newton is right with the gravity thing  #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 I bet parcel is just as trippy. Lol #TARDIStweets

Hindle has been taking stroppy teenager lessons from Adric! #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 Kinda and Snakedance are her finest #TARDIStweets

RT @DameRoger: Ten Tegans! This is now the scariest story in the history of the show! #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger oh dear. We're all doomed! #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 double the mouthy trouble. Lol #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 I want a box! Lol #TARDIStweets

Apparently this is Janet Fielding's favourite script. #TARDIStweets

@DrWho7Freak @djNezumi @DaftPhully @the_knights87 totally agree #TARDIStweets

@DrWho7Freak @djNezumi @DaftPhully @the_knights87 I'll be controversial. I'm bored of River now #TARDIStweets

@DrWho7Freak @djNezumi @the_knights87 @DaftPhully you're hired! :) #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 his cheese slid off his cracker. Lol #TARDIStweets

This scene reminds me of Alice in Wonderland #TARDIStweets

Molecular Biology; now you're talking #TARDIStweets

@djNezumi @DrWho7Freak @the_knights87 @DaftPhully so many theories about Her character. Looking forward to next year! #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 and its not her heels lol #TARDIStweets

@DameRoger yeah, that's a sure sign she's not herself #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 surely it has an emergency stop? #TARDIStweets

@TheCricketingDr meddling Adric #TARDIStweets

@djNezumi @DaftPhully @the_knights87 @DrWho7Freak exactly. Not Rose *cough* *cough* #TARDIStweets

@DrWho7Freak @the_knights87 @DaftPhully Agreed, can't stand the gooey eyed companions. Give me one with fire &amp; not in love #TARDIStweets

@DaftPhully @the_knights87 Janet Fielding acts her socks off in these #TARDIStweets

No comment on the title sequence. Lol #TARDIStweets

@djNezumi that's what I'm watching but the Kinda people aren't made of chocolate. I feel cheated. Lol. #TARDIStweets

@the_knights87 it is a good story, better than Snakedance. #TARDIStweets

Whenever I hear "Kinda" I think of the chocolate eggs with toys! XD #TARDIStweets

@LorienRadar sssssssssssssss XD #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet I think they should have just kept to bending spoons. Lol #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet yep, up for some funky tribal jiggery pokery. Oh yeah, and a silly snake. Lol #TARDIStweets

@TARDIS_Tweet evening dude #TARDIStweets

It's a bit of a Tennant tradition to gaze up lovingly at the TARDIS and pat the old girl fondly #TLSSessions

I ADORE the new TARDIS interior‚ù§‚ù§
