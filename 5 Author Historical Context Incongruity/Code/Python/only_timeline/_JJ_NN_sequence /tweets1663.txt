Could you imagine Timofey chase down blocking LeBron on the final possession and then staring blankly into the camera? I'm done.

If Mozgov was in, Warriors wouldn't have all these second chances. He erases offensive rebounds. By that I mean he blocks them out of bounds

In short, Steph is not in the same class as him. If LeBron wanted to go all out in the regular season, he would have ran away with the MVP.

People are so disrespectful. I hated on LeBron his whole career but, when it comes down to it, there's stars, superstars and then LeBron.

I think what's being underplayed about the Speights' missed dunk is Mozgov would have double clutch reversed that.. and made it. #NBAFinals

So the #Jets brought in two starting corners today. Is Dee Milliner officially a bust or am I late?

Interested to see how much more Revis will be making than Sherman. If it's a significant amount, that's not a good sign for the #Jets

I hope #Jets fans understand this is all about money for him. Highly doubt he believes he has a chance at another ring in New York.

Graham to Seattle is major but the Saints got a really nice haul back for him. I can definitely see why they did it.

And I thought the #Patriots wouldn't need a RB with Blount and Ridley but, now that he's gone, seems very likely the grab Gurley or Gordon.

@kerbiegibbs thanks for the idea. I might just have to put that to good use üòà

@kerbiegibbs haha alright. I believe you this time

@kerbiegibbs I should have came to you before I walked from off campus to Harris and my ears fell off üòû

Look at what was in my @timehop! @BCalixto7 bro, foam party rager this weekend? http://t.co/gIuupeansb http://t.co/PriycVfB4x

Been sitting in a warm classroom for 15 minutes and I still can't feel my face...

I'm all about the look that you're giving me.

I posted something on Instagram and I already know I'll be lucky to get like 10 likes. Twitter never does me like that.

Haven't posted something in a while so seeing your name in print is pretty cool. http://t.co/KekgDkIa0x

Misinformed analysts are getting roasted today and I love it. Don't spread your opinion if you haven't done your research.

RT @BlaiseInKC: @ChrisPalmerNBA @KDTrey5 I somehow doubt they fired you for being too smart.

If you're going to use a squat rack for more than an hour, save up money and buy one. Nobody has time for monopolizing machines.

RT @nickkroll: "I wanna go where nobody knows my face..." #Tonight #KrollShow http://t.co/vXQjPKXHti

@BCalixto7 saw it lol. There's a blogger online that pointed out all of the times he back tracked on what he said. It's crazy ESPN hired him

RT @darcymlittle: Jody Husky is the only one that understands him... I cry every time (unfinished) #drawing #graphite @JODYHiGHROLLER http:‚Ä¶

Too many times that I've seen the wrong signs. Empty out the hatred in life. We're bringing only good vibes.

RT @BCalixto7: @wILLuminatiii @Polsky34 watch your mouth. If he wants to be Dill Freeman, he will be, damn it

@wILLuminatiii @BCalixto7 to me the original is the ultimate compliment. Kind of disrespectful to think otherwise.

@wILLuminatiii @BCalixto7 ours are better http://t.co/rgLxsYcFnV

It's supposed to be 10 degrees warmer at 3AM tonight then it is right now... how exactly does that work?

"I was just saying..."

@BCalixto7 seriously might be the funniest I can remember because of how random and stupid it was when we first thought of it hahaha.

@ellenmcnamara34 tell me about it. I don't own enough pants to make it through winter lol.

Is it bad that Apple's headphones are tougher than their actual iPhones?

"When asked about your career goals you wrote 'I'm finna get dat money doe' care to elaborate?"

It was a clear black night, clear white moon. Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume.

@kerbiegibbs True that. I'm calling them Samoas either way haha.

RT @wealthypasta: like an L boy I ain't nothing to play with

RT @SportsCenter: In last 15 seasons, Patriots and Red Sox have combined for 7 championships. In the previous 50 seasons, they had 0. http:‚Ä¶

Watching the Butler interception reactions videos and one girl says, "What did I just tell you? Take the ball." If only it were that easy.

@Gortat_ what was Wilson doing all game? Throwing against Arrington and Ryan. It's a two-way street.

I STILL remember when Brady was washed up. #SB49

@Ant_DeMarco If it's 3 wide or less he's floating.

@Ant_DeMarco I know. Arrington is choking.

RT @Patriots: Tom Brady  just tied Joe Montana for the most Super Bowl TD  passes in @NFL history with his 11th. http://t.co/7htR2YkIWJ

Why would you cut away from the Gronk spike? It's the best part! #SB49

I don't think Sherman is the egotistical d-bag that everyone makes him up to be. He's a marketing genius who knows how to stay relevant.

@cringer95 I didn't watch. I was just stating in general.

I feel like John Legend is the designated national anthem singer for all major sporting events.

Why did I leave my Gronk jersey in NJ? üòû

RT @colechKID: My bad it's just Tom Brady

RT @colechKID: Why is there a Goat on the Field?

@ntn_tms no I don't have a DJ shift. I don't tweet during my game broadcasts I'm broadcasting the game lol. Kind of self explanatory.

I think Pepsi is using Vine "celebrities" for their new ads because they are somewhat recognizable and charge as much as someone who isn't.

@ntn_tms I don't have listeners. You do lol.

I've got the @Patriots winning #SB49! #PatriotsWIN @NFL http://t.co/wL8wrSRPeF

RT @GuyCodes: THIS GAME WAS GOAT http://t.co/EgaF8Mpd1A

I know, she knows, I'm not fond of asking. True or false, it may be... Well she'll still get it out of me.

I never understood the fascination with #NFL players being able to dunk. They are the best athletes in the world... I hope they can dunk.
