The good thing about the first episode though, is that it includes music by Imagine Dragons and Ben Howard :) &lt;3 #The100

I guess it would be a good thing if it's super cold at home next sunday. Cuz then I can wear my winter aka heavy clothes on the plane

The good thing about my headache, is that I always know when it's coming. So why do I have it now?? NOT FAIR!

Happy birthday to my sister! Now I've officially missed the whole household's birthday.. Ah well, good thing we have a new one every year ;)

Well, the good thing is I'm not blind. But my eye was glued shut this morning, so that's not so great. But it's getting better
