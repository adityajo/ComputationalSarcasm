@Viva_La_Patrick I mean... If you knew what sorority I was actually... In stead of making up some fake one!!! Lol

@madi_sun17 seriously?! There busy be a pillow case bandit on the loose here at SFA!! That's the only explanation for it!

@bt_Lumberjack Actually I think gross is the word you were looking for.. 😂

@bt_Lumberjack Thanks! Lol it's quieted down some! It's more like heavy breathing/stopped up nose...

@Viva_La_Patrick YOU'RE AVERAGE!! 😠

RT @Viva_La_Patrick: 40 tweets is about average. *Yawn* Looks at SFA student.

@KylerNielsen im thinking she wouldn't take to kindly to that.We usually say one or two words to each other a day. Not on that BFF level yet

@patsy94abate Thank you love! I sure hope so!! 😘

@patsy94abate good!! Love you amazing friend of mine!!! 💗💗💗

@patsy94abate @madi_sun17 it's okay! I forgive you! 😌

@KylerNielsen I'm betting I'm one of them because I'm tweeting a lot right now!

Talking to my big in the rain for 20 minutes. Why not?! ☔ @taylormay00

@KYLEis_2TFB she's here waiting for you! ;) me and her talked about you today actually!

@asanc13 yeah that probably has A LOT to do with it! Lol

@asanc13 @mpaige2012 I always had to cheer had softball the night before I took it! My sleeping habits have just worsened in college!

@MPaige2012 @asanc13 ohh no! Lol I fell asleep all three times I took it and I slept through the entire English part just about! Lol

@asanc13 best advice I can give: don't fall asleep every time you take it like I did. 👍
