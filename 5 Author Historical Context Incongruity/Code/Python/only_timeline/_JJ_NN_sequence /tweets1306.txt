@Erin_Worbs @PittDeltaLove remember when you were MIA before initiation worbs 😂

I just had to explain to my mom what a "happy ending" was....

@THEfamilyjulez wish i were an extrovert dangggg http://t.co/Dq8WIX1OmJ

The weirdness level of my passwords for websites/accounts are like fun little inside jokes I have with myself

So nostalgic and homesick for Pitt right now 😭😭😭 @BeanjaminButton I just wanna go dj with Marcus at boots

@stephlisty I'm kickin myself in the balls for being such an #idiot!!!!

Why didn't I go to Pitt this weekend ???

RT @smellykellyg: God I miss gamedays

@GergSays SO. WEIRD. I ponder this often.

@THEfamilyjulez I was paranoid that a grad school would look me up and think I was unstable !!

There is a 300% chance I will be sick tomorrow. #boogers #snot #slobber #children

@FeralXWolverine absolutely I'm in the middle of season 3 now!

RT @RJ_lll: You would think I collect empty water bottles by the amount I have in my car

If you think I'm wearing the same outfit to work that I wore out last night you are absolutely correct and everyone needs to leave me alone.

@stephlisty I love you

If you ever had to knock on wood 🎶 #tonyhawkproskater

One morning commute without having to listen to Katy perry roar is all I ask for.

Wonder which lucky trick or treater will step in the dog poop I didn't pick up in my front yard earlier. #happyhalloween 😏💩

@THEfamilyjulez @GEARsofwar21 I think you guys were there?? (Refer to my last tweet)

VERY IMPORTANT: I need to borrow a surf shirt for my costume someone please help me out !!!

It would just be nice to have a friend to go to a concert with me on Saturday. #SIGH #PITYME

If the couch and old carpet on my front lawn don't scream "classy" idk what does.

@xtina_723 she makes a valid argument I must say

Time hop is the best and worst app I've downloaded. Loling but also severely depressed.

@shapsticks @makeit_RAINNN I just threw up thanks guys

So I guess there will be a sequel to World War Z? I need some closure here.

@THEfamilyjulez @DesignByIKEA just thought maybe they'd throw me a bone since not one but TWO of the pieces broke as I was building.

It's like they ask the actors in Life Alert commercials to be as robotic and unrealistic as possible. #ivefallenandicantgetup

Is it a real thing that if you can't pay for your meal you wash dishes in the back or is that an urban legend?

I'm wearing a tshirt that says "keep calm and party" on the back. Someone come punch me in the face. I deserve it.

I literally just had to fill out an affidavit to get into the OD
