@SuzanneSimnick @bluepokiedotz  If restrictions on abortion were paired with free access to contaception, there might be room 2 compromise

@ClarenceWhorley @ron_fournier If you want a laugh, watch intro statements from '92 VP Debate - Quayle, Gore &amp; Stockdale

@SuzanneSimnick If men could get pregnant, women who relied on promise of birth control might be more sympathetic than deadbeat dads r today

@jpodhoretz Were they targeted as Driving While Hispanic? Might call for a DOJ investigation of Miami-Dade. But did they get the tix fixed?

@ron_fournier Ron - do you believe Obama's vision is as inspirational as Reagan's? If so, I believe you are in a small minority.

@ron_fournier Disagree. If everyone is exceptional, then no one is.

@secupp If you substituted the threat from "Islamic extremists" for "climate change", he'd consider himself an Islamophobe warmongerer

#greta My problem w/Morrell: If threat of attack warranted a security upgrade for "your guys", why was air support inaccessible - on 9/11?

If it were a fight Mike Morell's "guys" would be throwing in the towel for him @greta

@ron_fournier @HillaryClinton @bump If she has all the answers, why does she need any questions?

@Ken_Rosenthal @sturtze56 If Red Sox don't pursue him it could be true.

@ron_fournier @TheFix If Schweizer were female, would he be a nut, or a slut?

@jamestaranto But the inconsistency itself leads to more instability. If you don't have "organizing principles", who can rely on them?

@BigOShow  Why does the term "Big Daddy" keep popping into my head???

@jpodhoretz Did he express "legitimate grievances"? If left unaddressed, could he become a terrorist? if so, whose fault would that be?

#IfThe80sNeverStopped I'd be sipping a Zima in my Member's Only jacket

@gregroa @HowardKurtz just asking: If there was nothing to hide, why did Saddam deny access 2 weapons inspections, as required by int'l law?

@JonahNRO @tompetty If only Scott Walker were gay, with the voice of an angel ...

RT @KatTimpf: RT If you're watching this but know it doesn't mean anything anyway #SOTU

@StaciSturrock @pbpost If my wife asked me to, yes.

@JessicaChasmar Channeling Jeff Foxworthy: If you "know your place", you might be ... someone's bitch.

@kctimpf If the cigs had weed instead of tobacco, they would have just ticketed him.

@brithume As a rational actor, China will use alternative sources if they make econ sense. If not, they will simply disregard he deal.

@charlescwcooke @AlecMacGillis If Halbig ends up enforcing the law as written, just ascribe it to the stupidity of Supreme Court Justices.

@ron_fournier   So true. If it's a "czar", ought to report directly to POTUS, no? And Rice's cred can't go much lower

@ron_fournier @PressSec If allega'tn true, why is Dach advisor on global womens issues? If not, where's (old) proof the reporting is wrong?

@Thoseguys_CDub Rebuttable presumption means benefit of doubt. But an average Mom &gt; better Dad &gt; great grandparents. Law favors bio.

@Thoseguys_CDub But the rebuttable presumption favors Mom, then Dad, then others. Even if Mom and/or Dad take gay lovers.

@jpodhoretz If it were so easy, maybe TF can explain why the NYT (&amp; esp. Anthony Lewis) criticized his every move.

Does @KeithOlbermann go to funerals and tell grieving children their Dad wasn't really that good a guy to begin with? #Jeter

@JohnEkdahl @DLoesch @FDRLST Simple Q: If W. sought to "divide us from them" after 9/11, why hide Saudi involvement?

@davidaxelrod What Lois Lerner did was egregious. If the Obama Administration covered it up to avoid bad press, it's even worse.

@ShannonBream @FoxNews @edhenryTV If he cancels his vacation, the terrorists will have won.

@JessicaChasmar Don't agree with Dad's politics, but she's a pretty girl who looks like she's having fun.

@ron_fournier @ThePlumLineGS @brianbeutler If only 3 or 4 states declined exchanges, they would've used it as leverage to criticize them.

@stephenfhayes Like a parody of "Mean Girls": If Russia doesn't take "diplomatic path", they're going to be sitting alone at lunch.

@KateUpton @NETAPORTER If Kate Upton calls, you answer the G-D phone. And demand to Skype instead.

@BarackObama I'm a middle aged, white, Christian, straight, married, conservative man. Am I the one you're fighting? If not, then whom?

@tonygwynnjr Sorry for your (our) loss. Don't measure pride in baseball stats. Your Dad never did.

@ShannonBream If they really wanted privacy they should have skipped the Rose Garden Celebration. Instead, they brought added attention.

@ron_fournier If that line was written for her, it IS relevant. Does our National Security Adviser simply repeat anything she is told?

@DLoesch @AmandaMarcotte Just wondering: if student were lesbian, would invite have been harassment? If so, would that make AM  "homophobe"?

@ron_fournier If you "grease the ladder", don't you slide back down to the bottom?

@stephenfhayes If anyone complains they are hurt by O'Care, they are phony liars. Yeah, run on that....

@JonahNRO If they storm an embassy, will the Secy of State promise to throw Zuckerman in jail?

@BarackObama If Bubba was the first black POTUS, this tweet solidifies your position as the first Gay POTUS.

@patsajak Or was it Diddy instead of Daddy?

@ByronYork @TPCarney Like Reagan said, If it moves, tax it, if it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it.

@JessicaChasmar If you're a gay woman, you get a prime time slot

@tgoldsmith Obama voted not to raise debt limit. Sabotage? If Pelosi allowed votes to rescind Bush taxes, would that have been "sabotage"?

@HatingBreitbart Read Ireland's essay? She's right. But that doesn't excuse Dad. Parent Rule #1: Don't put your kids in embarrassing spot.

@HatingBreitbart @ABFalecbaldwin And I certainly wasn't defending Alec, who put his daughter in that predicament. Defend Dad or not?

@stephenfhayes @JonahNRO If anyone believes the ACA will not add one dime to the deficit, please say so now, loudly &amp; clearly

Einstein: If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign? http://t.co/Tac9clx5mW by @busybuilding

@KatiePavlich If they could only speak Arabic, like Arafat did.

@michellemalkin "If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth" - Joseph Goebbels

@kirstenpowers10 If the bombing was in pursuit of a political or religious agenda it is terrorism - using fear to advance long term goals.

If POTUS was a conservative, would Michael Moore make a movie showing how peaceful No. Korea is, and how happy their people are?

@JessicaChasmar Should incest laws apply to sisters (or brothers)? If so, why? ("It's gross" is not an acceptable answer)

@RepTedDeutch Sounds like recipe for tax REFORM (lower rates, eliminate deductions, revenue NEUTRAL). If you want to raise taxes, SAY SO!

@IrelandBBaldwin I disagree w/Dad's politics, but that doesn't mean I can't find YOU funny, clever &amp; interesting. You have a great future.

@jpodhoretz Or suggest to suggest that, by passing a football with Dad, you can have one, too!

If #BCS ran the NFL, they'd schedule the Pro Bowl on Super Sunday and play Super Bowl 2 days later. #makingnewyearsirrelevant

If Obama has lost The Chris Matthews Band, he's lost middle America. @jamestaranto

@TwitchyTeam If Keith heard it, what does that make him?

@Students4Obama If your Dad will let you sit there #fadedposter

@Students4Obama If your Dad will let you sit there #fadedposter

@Students4Obama If your Dad will let you sit there #fadedposter

@BarackObama "If you don't have a record to run on, you need to paint your opponents as people you must run from" BO 2008 (faded)

@michellemalkin If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a Filipino, I guess.

@BarackObama If you truly value families, you give your father's son $1,000 to pay a medical bill. #georgeobama

@michellemalkin @TwitchyPolitics "If you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters."- Barack Obama, 2008

@WhipHoyer Then extend the current rates! If u have the votes for an increase, propose it separately. #2200

@RepTedDeutch If it's a "choice" election, why compromise? Dems ought to extend current rates, &amp; run on platform of higher rates 4 "them".

@BarackObama If these are the results, fight for something else!

@pbsgwen Ms. Ifill if POTUS calls, you show up. 100% Obamas fault no meeting with McConnell.

@BarackObama Should that gap be reduced? If so, how will making more &amp; cheaper loans available help non-college folks?

@DanaPerino If Axe wanted to stop the Carter comparisons, he's done a fine job!

@jpodhoretz If women who don't depend on men are "real feminists" what do you call men who do not depend on women? Bachelors?

@davidaxelrod My car has a pre-existing dent. Should my new ins. co.pay to fix it? If so, who actually absorbs the cost?

#Obama2012 If POTUS needs 4 more years for policies to work, how can u blame Romney for 4 years as MA Gov?

Will media give same coverage to Brian Terry's Dad than they did Cindy Sheehan? #doubtful
