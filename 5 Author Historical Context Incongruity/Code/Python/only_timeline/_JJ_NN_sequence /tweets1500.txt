@OrtizKicks but Garrett Richards will be a buzz saw today. True test. It might be a K fest.

RT @JimmyTraina: The lowpoint of "BREAKING" has been hit. RT @SportsCenter: BREAKING: Richard Sherman wins #MaddenCover Vote.

RT @Alden_Gonzalez: Garrett Richards' bottom of the second: Three strikeouts, nine pitches.

RT @nfldraftscout: Trent Richardson was the No. 3 pick in the draft last year. The #Browns just gave him up for a 1st round pick. That's...â€¦

RT @ChrisSolis: Richard Greico often looks at Johnny Depp asks himself, "What could have been?".

RT @awfulannouncing: How people are still talking about Richard Sherman with any seriousness whatsoever is truly astounding.

@getnickwright if I thought Richard Sherman is a thug for the choke gesture, taunting Crabtree and provoking him does that make me a racist?

@LanceZierlein @Frobeus_NS so you see JJ playing the Richard Seymour type position?
