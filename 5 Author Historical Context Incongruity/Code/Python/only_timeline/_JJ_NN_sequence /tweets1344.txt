RT @ChrisIngy14: I think i'm getting sick.. #ThisSucks

RT @Kiariqua: "best friends"? we're not best friends. best friends don't forget about each other when they go to different schools.

@AustinMahone why weren't you in ATL like three weeks ago?! It would have been perfect 😊

RT @chantallnicolee: Awkward. #bestshowever

RT @FezTht70s: Birth Control Pills should be for men. It makes much more sense to unload a gun than to shoot at a bulletproof vest.
