Was it real or was it all in my head

#WhenIWasAKid it never rained in June

#WhenIWasAKid I had the pineapple hair, two pigtails if I was lucky

#WhenIWasAKid I lived on wotsits

#WhenIWasAKid I used to run around naked because I could

#WhenIWasAKid I used to think the 6 weeks holidays were 6 month

#MyNameWasSupposedToBe Reema, but she just thought she'd make it my middle name and give more names
