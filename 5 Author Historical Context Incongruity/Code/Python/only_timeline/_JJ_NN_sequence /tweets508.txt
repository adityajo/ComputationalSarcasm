@voose_lagina happy birthday cunt :D

@BrettMWalters it's not fixed yet ;)

Amazon changing their format for Kindle Unlimited and Kindle Lending Library royalties from an 'over 10% read' basis to a per page basis.

@MsRachyDoodle it tasted like one part happiness, two parts sadness.

@jh_70 I haven't but it doesn't surprise me. It's very much a country build to impress, substance is of little value.

@voose_lagina his incontinence and erectile disfunction issues are public knowledge?

@DavePhippen asides from classical it's definitely the most 'sticky' genre of music out there.

Hate to say it but Carlton @ $17 looks like unders. After the season they've had so far they will definitely be smacked about tonight.

@punkprat haha well there has been a strong positive correlation between Dale consuming coke and feeling much better! Balkan medicine ftw ;)

Would be a shame to lose @mmills05 next season, though a million bucks can go a long way towards finding a new domestic marquee player.

@owlstrokebear Australian TV is well behind the rest of the world in terms of sports access unfortunately. With the exception of local sport

@laenij perfect mermaid weather!

@owlstrokebear jumbo multi screen! Would be interesting to be at a pub with several games playing at once and fans from several teams.

@spiffybee haha there was several events set up in the city yesterday for watching Eurovision :D

@spiffybee haha unfortunately not. Closed due to presidential elections.

@BNEShrimper @BRFC_TheDen @NE_Brisbane great initiative!

@BrettMWalters yep, the preface says it all.

@punkprat nice, enjoy Split I hear it's a gorgeous city!

@thisisScoMan yep, it doesn't boost 'team spirit' or assist 'our sales goals' if you're not selling stuff to people who don't want/need it.

@thisisScoMan the scary part is predatory lending has been tightened up in the last couple of years, used to be much less restricted.

@punkprat how Croatia btw? Loving the pics :D

@punkprat having worked in a bank this is part of the reason why I left. Preying on people's short term desires and financial illiteracy.

@Daveo_au apparently it hasn't been finalised yet. I can provide him with emergency funds if needed, he never thought to ask me though.

@___Amy__ he was actually a therapist.

@BenCuzzupe it's like watching a social train wreck.

@scouse_roar Harry Kewell would be a great pick up by the club, we're really lacking a decent third sub option at the moment.

@Daveo_au @SarcasmFairy not too sure if The Smith Family have religious ties, they may be worth looking into.

@Daveo_au very true, it's seemingly more a lack of exposure to such ideas and concepts that's the problem, as you say logic won't do much.

@rinchinator eh that wouldn't fix anything though, education and awareness is the best solution, unfortunately he seems reluctant to both.

@emlypie just being all chill and primping his feathers and eating small bits of bread. No one ever suspects the ducks.

@Daveo_au you've confused me with that statement, how so?

@emlypie not so much dicks but utterly ignorant and closed minded to new ideas and concepts. Also ducks.

@cpccpremiers09 if you don't know the reasons why explore the answer for yourself rather than dismissing it as stupid or pointless.

@cpccpremiers09 every country/religion/person has their own rules they live by. I don't understand why you have an "us vs them" mentality.

@Redandblack91 and it's a non issue, it's still the same meat and tastes exactly the same.

@cpccpremiers09 your question makes no sense, no one can 'do what they want' in any country full stop, predominately Islamic or otherwise.

@cpccpremiers09 what difference does it make to you if someone chooses to worship a different god or live life by their own belief system.

@cpccpremiers09 and your 'true' statement is completely false and generalised. I know several Muslims who are as Aussie as the next person.

@cpccpremiers09 everyone has their own beliefs &amp; values, why do you get to decide what people should conform to in Australia?

@cpccpremiers09 @crackwhorexpres I didn't say you're racist I said your statement was xenophobic. "They" is a very strong statement.

@cpccpremiers09 @CrackWhoreXpres the meat isn't "blessed by Allah". Halal simply means it's permissible to be eaten under the rules of Islam

@cpccpremiers09 @CrackWhoreXpres "they" haven't requested halal fast food, it's been made available by savvy business owners.

@cpccpremiers09 @CrackWhoreXpres if you're going to post xenophobic remarks at least bring yourself up to speed on what you're talking about

@Gixibyte not too sure, from what I've read it's a 'free play' area, guessing that means you can go nuts building as you please.

@Gixibyte @Kontra108 from memory it was something to do with a specific case of police brutality.

@cpccpremiers09 I think you mean halal meat. If you don't know what it is it won't affect you in the slightest.

@Travinport sounds like you've had a ripper time, there's been some very entertaining tweets come out of it ;)

@Travinport homeward bound already mate? How's it been thus far?

@MVFCLR22 any idea who?

@spiffybee it would be an interrogation....with sexy results.

@matthew_collard "I like war" "I said I like war first and I'm pro explosions" "I'm pro explosions and killing people without trial".

@spiffybee AND HE WOULD YELL INSTRUCTIONS TO CTU WHILE IGNORING DIRECT ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT.

@sullenhowler you're not a superstar of the #mvfc :p That and I sent you a vibes message AND a birthday present!

Happy birthday to @10Archie and Marcos Flores, the best of both the old and new Victory share the same birthday!

@aussie_billy I think the majority of guys aren't total creeps, no need for those sort of actions, especially in a work environment.

@BenCuzzupe redirect them to the Post Office where they sell the set for $15. #tightarses

@nataliemoo he's in the public domain though so to speak, private Facebook photos are not though.

@voose_lagina google 'misty swimsuit competition' and 'James breast implants'. Very bizarre, as only Japan can be.

@voose_lagina the original unedited Japanese version of Pokemon is a creepy version of Pokemon.

@ChildishPalps would not be surprised if they turn out to be sex offenders, they have more than enough identifiable attributes.

@tanya2708 speaking of excited.... http://t.co/Xlpl4kiR

@leesieoh haha nope, nondescript brunette over here!

So @CmdrSheppard just tweeted about the most bizzare music video clip you'll ever see, Rammstein - Sonne.

@CmdrSheppard one of the most unique music videos of all time.

@ChildishPalps being an athiest doesn't give you a right to be a jerk but I think he missed that memo.

@SgtSupercoach @gerta38 he said it would be putrid, not perfect ;)

@traingirl21 surely you can't go past the handlebar or the reverse Hitler? :P

I think @gerta38 is growing a dirty mo again this year. @SgtSupercoach Anyone participating in Movember? I'd love to donate.

@cpccpremiers09 @WhiplashUnited retweeted a couple, not to say he endorses them though, he may or may not I don't know.

@cpccpremiers09 @WhiplashUnited I don't disagree with that, I do disagree with people who are overjoyed by the news though.

@emlypie yay, you get to spend the meantime window shopping and comparing specs! Will be a long time before I have enough cash for that :(

@emlypie well done, you're a little trooper :) When do you get to go bike shopping?

@emlypie how was the ride?

@phobes good luck!

@cpccpremiers09 @WhiplashUnited he failed to abide by the rules and he failed to come clean.

@WhiplashUnited he's been stripped of his titles and rightly so. There's no reason to be overjoyed by someone else's failures though.

@unsimplychelle they're both hypocritical groups of people who shit me.

@QuotesSimpson Uhh your fish are dead | I know, I can't get them out of there.

@LEGO_group Any news yet guys? #FestivalOfPlay

@unsimplychelle the one that irritates me more is Christians who get sick, take the medications, get better and then attribute this to God.

@jade_pallpratt to be fair I am pleasantly surprised Muscat hasn't thrown a chair at anybody yet.

@miss_invincible needs more foreplay.

@teacuptempest well that would be fucking handy if, y'know, I wanted to charge your phone in my car.

@TrillF1 if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem :p

@bertarii hopefully Georgia to vintner teaching English to kids. If all goes to plan I'll head off on your birthday.

@Todsta6 @_calleja The Producers &gt; Rock of Ages

@nonsensiblekate Arsenal. There's a lot of Arsenal fans on twitter and they're all great people!

@Suarez_1991 best of luck with it, good to see you're taking the opportunity while you can!

@bertarii Mum was worried enough about me moving to the UK, not sure how she would deal with a country that was formerly part of the USSR.

@Suarez_1991 very nice, that sort of thing looks great on the resume and gives you a chance to explore the world as well. Great opportunity.

@tanya2708 yeh why would you want to rule idiots out of contention anyway?

@laenij Georgia, China, Russia and Taiwan. Georgia is the only volunteer role so I'm really hoping that I'm accepted into it :)

@Suarez_1991 volunteer work teaching English at a public school in Georgia. Any idea of where/what you have in mind at this stage?

@tanya2708 that was my thought too. They also won't accept you if you have an STD or any alcohol or driving related offences.

@laenij elsewhere, applying for a couple of different countries and using the UK as a fallback option in case I don't get accepted.

@grand_dalliance haha I'm pretty much the least intimidating person ever.

@grand_dalliance ok here's a photo of my....oh...you want a photo of my smile....I don't have a picture of that.

@voose_lagina it's the same as you wanting to move to Australia, the prospect of moving somewhere different is enticing!

@voose_lagina I can stay here and do the same thing day in day out or I can get out and explore the world and get paid to do so. No decision

@sarahllouise it's round but a specific kind of round ;)

@sarahllouise No problems, happy to assist in confusing you further haha.

@TheDivineMrsO In defence of Tiger it's common practice to oversell flights.

@sarahllouise Earth is an oblate spheroid.

@laenij well that's a positive then! I'm here if you need to talk/vent about anything :)

@phobes it means your mum is naked. I think.

@tanya2708 ooh good point, no point buying a cheap printer if you pay a premium for the ink.

@voose_lagina possibly, there's a few countries on the radar at the moment.

@_calleja just remember she's looked after you every day for the last 20 odd years, she didn't raise you so you could be a jerk to her ;)

@_calleja I was an utter prick to Mum as a teenager and still feel really guilty about it now, I know your position mate.

@_calleja apologising and/or doing soemthing nice for them restores that karma balance :)

@laenij I'm a big boy I'll be right. Going to spend the night curled up on the couch reading :)

@allthepie it's a survival of the fittest model that encourages people to put themselves first and the others second. Completely flawed.

@amyyroberts hahaha best back handed compliment ever.

@GotarBender home games for each club. 2012 meant an extra game per week yet crowd figures down ~300,000 even with the extra game.

@teacuptempest waterboard them, that shit's the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life.

@sarcastic_chef @M3lizza to be fair you don't get much of a chance to hear it and learn the words :P

@GotarBender interestingly no, when you omit the GWS and Suns data the figure drops to ▼5.46% as the 2011 Suns crowd didn't impact as much.

@bookshopaddict ▼5.46%, the GWS's 119,073 overall figure is actually worth quite a bit in the 2012 season.

@sarcastic_chef @M3lizza give it a couple of seasons when they squeeze into the top 8 and that figure will boom. AFL wouldn't be concerned.

@BrettMWalters the original plan was to compare membership prices per club and the number of members but I couldn't find enough data.

@M3lizza it's to be expected, if you're getting belted by 100 plus points each week people tend to tune out pretty quickly.

@spiffybee I'm unique :P

@emlypie two is just like, too big man, it's like resting your head on a mountain. Be at one with the bed and your body will thank you.

@emlypie 1, would happily sleep on none as well but apparently that's weird and scares people.

@emlypie sounds like a fair deal, I'll straight swap the insulin for the Valium. #PleasureDoingBusiness

@tanya2708 I wish that's how I function, unfortunately when I have ideas they need to be completed yesterday or else I get agitated.

@NiKKi_E13 what do you usually call them? Residents, homebodies, acquaintances?

@emlypie so your plan is to give me diabetes and then steal my Valium. I'm on to you!

@emlypie you're offering me more than what I initially wanted, I'm skeptical now. It's a fake Pokemon card isn't it!

@WhiplashUnited had to laugh at the chant that went up behind me, "Billy Celeski, he makes spastics look good."

@WhiplashUnited picked a bad spot to handle it. After his cracking first half it was disappointing to see.

@emlypie i'll trade it to you for a dozen subway cookies and a shiny charizard Pokemon card.

@emlypie 1. Replace cold and flu meds with valium 2. ??????? 3. Profit

@phobes @laenij Bond is notorious for being as subtle as a sledgehammer when it comes to product placement. He's a total product whore.

@phobes @laenij scratch that, he moved to Omega in Goldeneye. Prior to that he was a Rolex guy. Incidentally Daniel Craig is also Rolex.

@laenij @phobes changing watches in Casino Royale grinded my gears but I could deal with it, changing preferred beverages is a judas move.

@laenij hmm according to the AEC website you can't anymore :( You totally forgot to add me on Facebook too btw!

@TheDivineMrsO a fool and their money are easily parted.

@gerta38 he wasn't born to wear the red and black, he wasn't born to give decent odds.....

@rinchinator I would definitely recommend a game at AAMI Park then, it's a hundred times better that at the soulless Etihad.

@rinchinator Come on Melbourne! Oh....you're not talking about the soccer are you :p

Said advertising. I didn't realise I'd logged onto Centrebet's website instead of @Essendon_FC's.  http://t.co/yVdfTiB5

@_calleja true, however there would be no discrimination in the eyes of the law and thats the basis of my gripe.

@_calleja how so?

@emlypie not too bad, slept from 6am-2pm as that was the earliest I could get to sleep. Other than that a very good day :)

@RachyVool haha yeh, I watch episodes in bulk online. Realised yesterday the only Australian shows I watch are all on the ABC or SBS anyway.

@emlypie yeh a solid nights sleep will be worth its weight in gold tomorrow. Good luck with your exam!

Nicely done. RT @Brisbane_Roar The Den release a statement regarding their opinion of flares: http://t.co/lZtiluYB

@emlypie how are you fairing missy? Wide awake or ready to crash and sleep?

@RachyVool I have &amp; always will purchase books. I'll pay for concerts to see bands and movies at cinemas. Agreed that FTA is a joke though.

I'm being followed by @TheChalmersClan, a twitter account to "to join up all those Chalmers across the world!" Clearly not Simpsons fans.

@thatsjenna haha to be fair my tweets are hard to understand at the best of times!

@RachyVool oh god, nothing irritates me more than not being able to purchase a kindle book because Australians aren't allowed.

@thatsjenna it was sarcasm, Richmond v Carlton &gt; daylight &gt; Essendon v Adelaide ;)

@grand_dalliance Jack Bauer is another who would benifit from a sideways move in profession.

@BrettMWalters that's a pretty good reason why not to fuck you.

@Gixibyte 15:35 flight back to Melbourne.

@Daveo_au 38.6 kilometres, that's utterly amazing.

@jackienopants @emlypie no sleep Monday sounds good in theory but in practice it would likely lead to becoming a crazy person haha.

@voose_lagina very fair call, that sums up my end as well.

@emlypie yeh napping seems to throw out the sleep cycle but staying awake another 14 hours will be a killer. I've got no plans today :)

@emlypie any plans for today? An afternoon nap might do the trick.

@voose_lagina haha are you a fan of trees or just the forum?

@emlypie no sleep you can power through, 5 hours is that sucky in between period where your body now craves sleep. Would rather 3 than 5.

@emlypie I'm in the same boat ATM, haven't slept all night and still wide awake. Think I may be a vampire but eh, what can you do.

@emlypie YOU WOULDN'T SLEEP THROUGH A MOON LANDING!

@emlypie yeh but watching history unfold before your eyes &gt; watching a replay. replays are for history lessons.

@voose_lagina what the hell are you doing on /trees/ anyway ;)

@emlypie red bull* red bill will no doubt bring up a host of other sites you thought you'd never see.

@emlypie oh shit, a video camera. I knew there was something they forgot to take with them :p google red bill stratos &amp; the site will pop up

@tanya2708 yeh but you may choose to pass my computer onto Mum.

@bookshopaddict stick insects are simply fascinating and unexpectedly violent.

@bookshopaddict that looks so cool!

@voose_lagina that's what happens to me as well, it goes all dry and blotchy in hard water. Clearly you need to move ASAP haha.

@voose_lagina I had a brief look at the UK stats, everyone over there has it rough, you especially! Does it affect your skin at all?

@pt_hippie I'd share it in an instant if I could, I'd also lend a house key if it was able to get you into the house haha.

@pt_hippie just content with who I am/where I'm going/how I'm getting there/what things mean to me. It's a good position to be in :)

@pt_hippie there's worse ways to spend an afternoon :) I'm good, very happy with life at the moment

@pt_hippie you can't break in?

@LayLay_K it could be worse, onions and asparagus are very low carb as well. #NellyNoFriends

@BrettMWalters that's if I don't get burnt at the stake first.

The downside of flying @tigerairwaysaus is that you fly @tigerairwaysaus. Just 2 check in counters open for a queue of 80+ people. #sigh

@BrettMWalters well to be fair I probably do weigh the same as a duck. #Illturnyouintoanewt

@LayLay_K and cauliflower. So much fucking cauliflower haha.

@LayLay_K on the upside a carb free diet makes shopping a breeze ;) #canteatthat #orthat #orthat

@BrettMWalters I see what you did there. But yeh you're pretty much spot on, it plays havoc with my delicate, effeminate skin. #manlyman

@sullenhowler you are now naked :p #andthistimeimspoton

@BrettMWalters Section 4 lists the hardness of water by major capital city, Melb is soft at 10-26 while Adelaide is very hard at 134-138.

@BrettMWalters nah it depends on the sources and delivery process. Additionally water can and often is 'softened' for domestic use.

@BrettMWalters it dries my skin out and makes it all blotchy. My Mum's house is serviced by hardwater and I can't shower there.

@punkprat and took up apprenticeships instead whereas now they're obliged to stay until at least year 10.

@punkprat indeed, the problem is though that the school system hasn't changed to reflect this, previously those kids dropped out early

@SuperTriviaGuy This video sums it up nicely, albeit a tad exaggerated &amp; a touch over the top but the message is there. http://t.co/JvKTJmF2

@SuperTriviaGuy people are jerks mate. Fortunately you have the ability to decide if you let them affect you at all :)

@bertarii it's a very low level of creepy compared to say stalking or up skirting.

@chetzone is that for your Jewish and Islamic customers who want the delicious taste without the consequences of a lifetime in hell?

@bertarii If that's the definition of creep then I'm a Grade A creep, I've done it several times in the past for that reason haha.

@punkprat try and mould students into an 'employable' state.

@punkprat given so little opportunity to utilise the skillets they have. School also actively discourage entrepreneurial thinking &amp; instead

@punkprat generally the 'lost cause' kids exceed other students when it comes to hands on and construction work, the problem is they are

@bertarii yeh I love people watching too but it's fairly quiet today :( The windows at the front of Young &amp; Jacksons are the best for that!

@punkprat yeh social skills, sport etc are essential parts of learning however the traditional school system could definitely evolve too.

@punkprat yep, spot on. Home schooling does have its merits but the article basically implies all home schooled kids just do what they want.

@scouse_roar that's pre-surgery. I was hoping you would be a little more supportive of my nintendoectomy.

@voose_lagina wouldn't surprise me, they're owned by news limited.

@voose_lagina it does teach management, planning and organisational skills but none of that is mentioned in the article.

@Halo_4 I can see the merits in home schooling however the examples used are very poor, at least find people who can highlight the pros.

@voose_lagina they're pretty bad examples, home schooling has its merits but 'we didn't use nappies' &amp; 'minecraft helps learning' don't help

@thatsjenna that was the entertainment section wasn't it? :p

@laenij he did in the slashfic version!

@tanya2708 don't make threats you wouldn't carry out :p

@tanya2708 now who's hungover and feeling like death :p

Despite the score line yesterday was pretty rad. It was also great to meet @Gixibyte, @BenitoWill and a currently very happy @scouse_roar.

@danielnardella1 spot on, Thomas looks like a striker playing as a keeper at the moment, serious awareness and positioning problems.

@robertabust oooh that's a high possibility!

@BenCuzzupe absolutely woeful and beyond frustrating. Should have been 6-0.

@robertabust tonight? I'm still in Brisbane :p

@BenCuzzupe #glassthebarman we actually spent the pub time socialising with the Roar fans, it was pretty strange but not bad as a one off.

@robertabust @rhondaperky haha terrible 80's music is the best music! Enjoy the rest of the evening, remember karaoke is best in duets!

@robertabust the day was pretty rad, [particular sport] was woeful but all in all I'm a happy camper :) not going out tonight?

@punkprat  anyone who harasses you for doing that is not your friend.

@punkprat oh god a warm bath would make it 10 times worse wouldn't it? Go find a supermarket cool room to sit in for the afternoon ;)

@allthepie @teacuptempest I would love to see peoples police records tattooed on their foreheads.

@emlypie Last time I went I was told to come back in 12 months because I had consensual sex with someone who lives *gasp* overseas.

@emlypie it's in the questionnaire but they still make you show up before they tell you your dirty homosexual blood won't be accepted.

@teacuptempest @allthepie sacrilege, everybody should inhale Jesus at least once in their lives.

@siandart yep that's fine but as soon as you have sex with a dirty gay man then you're inelligable.

@laenij they haven't no, they'll just wait until you go out of your way to turn up and then they let you know they still discriminate.

@2drinksbutts he's 30 years old and looking at the bigger picture and long term prosperity of the club two draft picks is a good return.

@tanya2708 you might be a bit tired for work tomorrow but in the end it doesn't even matter.

@emlypie are you sure you don't have a beard because that is very true and very wise.

@voose_lagina I haven't had one dream about denim shorts yet. Guess this means I win the first round :p

@emlypie it's an ongoing thing, has happened numerous times before but never this bad. Best to knock the problem out altogether. How was it?

@EmilyHeyWhatNow they do bagels now? Wow they really have stepped it up a notch since I last visited in the AM.

@emlypie big weekend I take it? I can't do anything in moderation so complete abstinence looks to be the only option at this stage.

@emlypie without going into too much detail I got drunk and made an idiot of myself. Again.

@EmilyHeyWhatNow oh god yes and a sausage and egg mcmuffin.

@emlypie after my clusterfuck of a Friday night I'm off drinking again. I'll settle for a coke though :)

@emlypie it's ok I'll head up just prior to 10:30 and get a big pile of hotcakes then :)

@EmilyHeyWhatNow it's pretty much the worst day of my life. Definitely making sure I'm up before 10:30 so I can get some later on!

@emlypie you knew it didn't start until 5 and you let me put on pants anyway? Wow, I don't know what to say, that's very, very cruel.

@emlypie good to hear you've got the  accommodation sorted, just the moving bit to go ;)

@emlypie that's the perfect excuse for pancakes, it's the last chance you'll get! So when's the big move?

@emlypie who do you think I am, Jamie Oliver or something? :p from scratch is too much trouble at this time of morning.

@miss_invincible arbitrary numbers are srs bsns.

@emlypie someone appears to have 'borrowed' my pancake mix. Pants it is.

@emlypie about to flip a coin if I make my own pancakes or head to Maccas. Because pants.

@emlypie we do but you've given me a better idea, pancakes!

@emlypie that's ok we'll still be here if it doesn't work out and if it does you have a whole heap of places to crash when you visit!

@emlypie that's only natural though, who wouldn't be scared doing something like that.

@emlypie diving into the unknown is an amazing experience, you'll have an absolute blast and learn a lot from it too, I'm sure.

@jodz semi intentional. Have cut right back on carbs which is probably why, don't want to lose any more though, I'd become a shadow!

@adidaq depends, does he look like a bitch?

@Juanita_Powell are you going tonight Juanita? If you're not I recommend cancelling all plans and getting down there, it will be superb!

@CrackWhoreXpres yeh don't see the need to glorify their destruction.

@CrackWhoreXpres respectfully disagree, growing up on a farm they would often maim/kill newborn lambs and calves. Feral pest, nothing more.

@hentystomp it's ok, I won't blame the messenger.

@laenij night Lou.

@Gixibyte but how am I supposed to see the game if you're waving flags everywhere? #ThingsYoullHearRoundOne

@jodz Dark City was quite unique, not half bad though!

@clementine_ford it's for science though!

@_calleja again in that case you need new friends then if they leave you out of things because you don't drink.

@_calleja yep. You'll still survive irregardless of wether she likes you or not.

@_calleja @laenij @grand_dalliance In that case why would you worry about their opinions one iota? They count for nothing in your world.

@phobes @laenij @grand_dalliance @_calleja the problem with that is when somebody says "I'm off to the bar I'll get you another gin".

@_calleja @laenij @grand_dalliance I would put that down to your choice of friends not your choice of teetotalism. Alcohol =/= fun.

@grand_dalliance @_calleja that's because I didn't get a chance to talk to you all night!

@grand_dalliance @_calleja I did it at MTUB and survived. Of course it was weird and everybody questioned it but I survived.

@CrackWhoreXpres there are two rules.

@CrackWhoreXpres Everybody has a crush on Jason Statham wether they know it or not.

@CrackWhoreXpres hardly, he's no Jason Statham.

@CrackWhoreXpres pass. Anything with Ryan Gosling in it is automatically ineligable for selection.

Dark City it is. Thanks to @jodz for the suggestion.

@jodz Done. I'll start acquiring it now.

@CrackWhoreXpres I watched that about a month ago. #HandsOverMyManCard

@finitovision cheers, I'll have a look at the reviews and go from there. Have seen the latter 3, all of which are very well done.

@gobbles21 Yeh Moneyball was very good, read the book afterwards and it's even better.

@aliceinwonderz I watched the Tim Burton version not long ago, it's pretty damn good!

@BenCuzzupe All great films and cult favourites, great suggestions!

@gobbles21 *must be downloadable. Might have to check it out another night though!

@gerta38 anything, I'm pretty chill.

@aliceinwonderz haha which version :P

@GotarBender I don't think there is a single decent song that encourages people to put their hands up in existance.

@andrewyesterday I can get it up and running tonight all I need is your full name, credit card number and expiry date ;)

@GotarBender that was next on my list but I was a couple of characters short :(

@andrewyesterday think of it as a cardio workout. In full clubbing gear. While drunk.

@gobbles21 players with no other offers aren't at an AFL standard, those that are go to one of the other 17 clubs that aren't Port Adelaide.

@bookshopaddict true, Saints still have Grand Final experience &amp; a mature list. Think they're a roughie chance, not quite a Geelong though.

@gobbles21 ooh, that makes things tough for the smaller clubs. Wasn't it supposed to help level to playing field.

@gobbles21 wouldn't be surprised if they threw a couple of lifelines or two year deals at some older players from other clubs for a boost.

@andrewyesterday doubtful but not completely out of the question.

@gobbles21 Every day one of the players gets a call and wins $10,000 when they say "I watch Sunrise on 7" live on air.

@CrackWhoreXpres oooh in that case Metro are being nice. Enjoy this apparent mistake while it lasts haha.

@CrackWhoreXpres they have express trains between Jolimont and Clifton Hill reguarly though?

@gobbles21 true but it does risk sqeezing out the likes of Pendlebury, Swan, Thomas, Beams or Sidebottom.

@gobbles21 Not as risky as Cloke for 5 years @ $800k per season ;)

@gobbles21 Ensures he sees out his career as a Bomber and a lot of that can be paid as veterans pay. We need someone like him for structure.

@grand_dalliance I love the colour coordination, it's like a colour wheel of healthy!

@AmLizabeth six weeks until summer, just enough time to get ripped ;)

@davutovic @Brisbane_Roar might want to point this second error out to your proof reader, two mistakes in one article. http://t.co/87mA3WYd

@Danny__Bishop off putting, looks to news-y and text based. Not as enticing as it could be.

@AmLizabeth phase it in, veggies one night a week then two etc. same for gym, one hour a week then two etc.

@laenij @Brisbane_Roar @davutovic insightful, unbiased and accurate news stories. Nah I'm just kidding, they're complete flogs.

As @Brisbane_Roar has pointed out The Hun has a horribly outdated article by @davutovic on the upcoming #melbderby. Pathetic as always.

@robertabust @Tw1sty you can use the exact same expressions I gave you yesterday, just sub 'Sydney' for 'Melbourne' and away you go.

@laenij when they say every flavoured beans they mean it. George swears he got a bogey flavoured one once.

@robertabust haha sounds like a fun day all in all then, good to see you at least tried to like the game before giving up on it!

@laenij ooh fun did you get show bags? My mates finally left so I'm chilling on the couch sans pants.

@robertabust post nap question. How was your Grand Final day yesterday, all educated on the wonders of AFL?

@BoxyFrown what the hell did I just click on. #myeyes

@BrettMWalters I forgot my dads until I got a message reminding me at 8pm. #oops

@DeBonoUniverse rather self explanatory. Apologies for picking your tweet in particular though, it happened to be an on hand example.

@RachyVool yeh around people I don't know I go into recluse mode &amp; batten down the hatches too. Good to hear you're overcoming the fears!

@laenij yep a few of us have tried to broach the subject gently but he thinks it's all one big laugh and it's fine.

@RachyVool one on one and small groups I'm fine, large groups I really struggle with though. You're like a socially awesome person :D

@RachyVool nah they're for awkward people like me, he needs to realise other people can and do have a different opinion of him than he does.

@laenij yeh he treats women like they're there for his amusement and to cater to his every whim and then complains he never gets laid.

@RachyVool I'm not fussed wether I get laid or not these days, he's all about getting laid and gets none. Reeks of desperation.

@tanya2708 @RachyVool haha love it.

@RachyVool you're spot on though, he treats women like they're his servants and wonders why he never gets laid.

@_calleja he won't take the hint about leaving, he's content to sit around all day and do nothing. So bloody annoying.

@_calleja you know how they say the more you talk about sex the less you're getting. This guy is the epitome of that statement.

@bertarii you come with me you speccy bowl haired cut fuck eat more small dick skinny cunt eat more wanker.

@bertarii I'll put my dick in the owl

Hey @Juanita_Powell you can add Jobe Watson to my list of man crushes alongside Billy Slater. What a champ!

@White_Ox I'll ride shotgun on said bandwagon, he was my longest odds victory of the night.

@EssendonBomber I can take it off your hands :P

@welldonesimon that was a bloody good bet actually, only 2 votes in it and well over the odds.

@EmilyHeyWhatNow @teacuptempest She looks too smart to be dating a footballer. She must be a good actor.

@teacuptempest @EmilyHeyWhatNow ah ok. That clears it up. Sort of.

@EmilyHeyWhatNow I hope your next Brownlow fact tells me who Asher Keddie is ;) #noclue

@aliceinwonderz Im thinking Apu as a hummingbird levels of hyper haha.

@aliceinwonderz uh oh, someone's going to be cranky this afternoon :p

@greg_warren85 no idea for who will win overall, Watson top 5 was the only bet I put on for overall standing.

@phobes @louhetrick in order to win you have to have finished your drink otherwise your disqualified. Its a magnificent game!

@Brentendo_64 ah of course, Europeans are too one eyed about these things ;) #Trolololol

@tanya2708 I did, I was getting ready for work so I forgot :/

@miss_invincible don't sweat, they've got this in the bag. Just trust me on this one!

@Brentendo_64 footy to me is AFL, football is soccer. Everyone has a different view on it of course but that's mine.

@sullenhowler nah Aussie rules. In Vic/SA/WA/NT footy = Aussie Rules. In NSW and QLD footy = rugby.

@Brentendo_64 footy =/= football ;)

@teacuptempest I'm a little crusty on the plan, the breadth and width of it all hasn't been wholly ingrained upon me yet.

@teacuptempest @emlypie you're both sick, sick people.

@emlypie and are over the age of 65. What could possibly be amazing about gin anyway?

@emlypie i thought gin was for old ladies.

@voose_lagina I'm going to call you the TMI fairy ;)

@aliceinwonderz indeed she did, my first thought was its a goal, thankfully she had the sense to refer it to the man upstairs.

@aliceinwonderz her first question was "if it's below the knee that's a goal yeh?"

@voose_lagina razor burn AND nair burn. You really need to start treating your sensitive bits a bit better! :p

@voose_lagina bahahaha that's hilarious. At least it did what it promised on the bottle.

@mjwill90 ooh ok that makes sense then. I imagine there's a few 1337 and 1701 pins floating around at comic-con as well though.

@mjwill90 that said approx 20% of people tried to set a pattern PIN when I worked at the bank, so 20% of people are that stupid.

@mjwill90 that's incorrect, banks won't let you have a pattern PIN, all three of those would be rejected as potential PIN.

@aussie_billy that sounds pretty damn good actually, a hell of a lot cheaper than AAMI park too!

@NiKKi_E13 yeh pre-drinks has always been a social affair for me, especially given you can't hear people once you actually go out.

@mizzmag is it wrong I started reading this tweet and straight away knew it was you who retweeted it?

@BenCuzzupe I'm guessing Whacking Day is coming up shortly then?

@NiKKi_E13 I am but that doesn't mean I'm off socialising :)

So I have Friday off work. Do people even do pre @MTUB drinks, because I would be down for that.

@andrew_54 needs more Jacob Oram too.

@dookbaws AAAAHHHH! YOU LOOK ADORABLE WITHOUT MAKEUP ON!

@voose_lagina Or throw something left of field out there and send him as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or James Bond from his written movies.

@voose_lagina you could send him as Mr Fox, a giant peach, the BFG, a witch or Matilda. All of a sudden Willy Wonka is looking pretty good.

@sullenhowler true it sounds a lot more serious than it actually is.

@unsimplychelle there's none locally other than the big two, usually hit up the South Melbourne market but it's closed today.

@Lucy_wa apparently it's a statewide thing. Because broccoli is so damn difficult to organise you know.

@sullenhowler Doctors surgery is the GP, just chasing up another prescription of antidepressants.

@louhetrick the bakers finish at 7, what gives?

@louhetrick @phobes it sounds like the sort of place that would serve $15 pints. I'll likely see you guys there :)

@phobes ooh fair enough. Where's it at this month?

@phobes why are you drinking at 10:05 in the morning?

@voose_lagina was it jesus fucking Christ?

@BrettMWalters *guitar bit*

@BrettMWalters oh oh oh oh

@sullenhowler they're gone now, you had your chance. Also it's a song, google it!

@sullenhowler where's your head at?

@BrettMWalters no gym and upper body cardio is a pretty tough equation right there.

@emlypie haha they're cool!

@BrettMWalters rowing. Rowing is the bomb, though it does involve a very small amount of work in your calves.

@Daveo_au indeed it does, they're pretty much on the same level unless your salad was deep fried.

@gobbles21 Clearly cut from the same mould as Simon Katich, neither of them can keep either.

@gobbles21 Do I hear a foghorn? BOOOOORING.

@tristessa_xo is 'awesomest' spelt with one 't' or two?

@tanya2708 not quite, I'm far too lazy for that sort of thing today.

@grand_dalliance oh yeh, you get your daily recommended dose of potassium in a single serve you filthy girl.

@ticktickticktic that's impressive, of course you could always just lay the seats down and sleep on those instead :p

@NiKKi_E13 what line? I can't ever remember it being in there :/

@NoogsCorner or period, it makes things sound deadly serious. Period.

@NiKKi_E13 when did the lyrics ever have 'cor blimey' in them?

@BrettMWalters go outdoors?

@emlypie haha enjoy your diabetes bro! We need to monopoly sometime soon too!

@Gixibyte the Saints are no Newcastle haha. That said might be worth a sneaky fiver on the draw, if anyone can fuck this up it's Arsenal.

@BrettMWalters squats are worse than water torture but they do amazing things. Burpees as well.

@BrettMWalters oh yeh, just wait until morning, that's when you'll feel it!

@emlypie it's our wedding cake. Done. What's next on the agenda?

@MirrorFootball they'll bail soon if they continue these slips.

@BrettMWalters I assumed you were morbidly obese and conquered a flight of stairs.

@BrettMWalters must have been one hell of a flight of stairs.

@_calleja @grand_dalliance night guys.

@grand_dalliance @_calleja can't say I'm a crier but everyone has different ways of coping with things.

@grand_dalliance not sure if you're serious or not but I heartily endorse shrooms. Erm I mean if they were legal of course.

@teacuptempest people who bitch and moan about self inflicted circumstances in general, man up and be accountable for a change.

@grand_dalliance if that's what you need to do then that's what you need to do :)

@grand_dalliance yeh I've had days like that as well, turned up to the train station and just couldn't get on the train to go to work.

@teacuptempest people get drunk and spew tweets everywhere. Not classy. That said I have been guilty of this numerous times too.

@grand_dalliance morning depression is worse than crossing a pit of lego in bare feet :(

Hey @yarratrams thanks for having a completely shit service, I caught the tram running 10 minutes late just as I arrived at the stop.

@andrew_54 for some reason every tweet I read of yours I expect it to be a McBain quote haha.

.@metrotrains you have literally one out of four exits open at Richmond station and it's the furthest one from the MCG. Sort your shit out.

Hey @metrotrains why the hell haven't you opened the west end of Richmond station for foot traffic to the MCG? You're completely useless.

@louhetrick http://t.co/IpG568oX your future Queen showing her wares.

@ShortBlokeJosh well both options will get rid of excess stress, I might give your idea a go and see how it works out :P

@tanya2708 possibly, depends on how the afternoon pans out haha.

@Daveo_au I give it two hours until you're ready for an afternoon nap haha.

@Daveo_au it's an odd predicament. Do I gym? Do I watch a movie? Do I read? Do I go back to sleep? We need some direction in life haha.

@cpccpremiers09 they're big in the film industry, mostly films that end up on SBS I guess haha.

@cpccpremiers09 merkin* it's a pubic wig.

@___Amy__ how good is the weather...at AAMI stadium for the footy tonight. Oh god, I tried, I just can't do it.

@emlypie nice that sounds like fun! How's the rib?

@voose_lagina perhaps we need to see both sets of boobs so there is no more confusion. It's the only logical way.

@voose_lagina oh it's Pippa? Well in that case boob on Britan!

@janey3putt Essendon v Gold Coast got more than than this final has. Pathetic from the Adelaide fans.

@voose_lagina Harry can play up, he's not going to be King. Pippa needs to get her shit together or us Aussie will become a republic :p

@tanya2708 highly possible, it's a funny story.

@voose_lagina also nice rack!

@voose_lagina she's the future Queen ffs, I'm not a monarchist at all but that's still highly disrespectful.

@Chetzone @rachyvool you'd make a good undercover guy, infiltrating bike gangs, drug operations etc.

@tanya2708 I did that once, I went into 7/11 with my hoodie on and the cashier started frantically pressing the silent alarm :o

@andrewyesterday seems to be the consensus, if you're unfit and happy to accept mediocrity you become a PSO instead.

@RachyVool @Chetzone Vicpol wouldn't have you because you have brains and ethics.

@sopharii he's recuperating in Cohuna at the moment but not too bad all things considered thankfully.

@voose_lagina I've missed something here, why are Kate Middleton's tits so important?

@Daveo_au that's base pay, quickly moves up to the range of $70k-ish and then gradually moves up from there. PSO is fixed $45k pa.

@RachyVool @Chetzone ah so it appeals to the lazier wannabe cop types. Makes sense but for that kind of pay it's not worth it IMO.

@andrew_54 @bookshopaddict Pies to win by 4 goals or so, West Coast's injuries and track record at the MCG will work against them.

@NiKKi_E13 ooh that's no good thankfully you have the weekend to recover! Joel's doing alright, at home resting up at the moment.

@bookshopaddict @andrew_54 also think the Dockers will get up, can't see Adelaide doing this tonight.

@Lucy_wa ah nice, no wonders she's happy then she's glad to be back with her mum. She looks absolutely adorable as well :)

@traingirl21 yeh that was rather disrespectful, you don't want to be remembered as the jerk who pots next to people that's for sure.

@dookbaws ooh yeh I guess that's like saying 'Australian airport'. Your mate haha.

@zoomosis and people know exactly what they taste like. Delicious.

@traingirl21 previous seasons haven't really had much of a villain. Must say these young captains irritate me, too headstrong and abrupt.

@dookbaws that sounds like a pretty dull story then, airports are the least exciting places on earth haha.

@traingirl21 I'm up to episode nine of Deadliest Catch, not only does Elliot irritate me more but he's turned into a creepy stalker.

@Lucy_wa have you got a pic of your new kitty? This is the internets after all.

@emlypie yeh, that's the kind of awesome colouring in talking about, that looked really call.

@_calleja just make sure it's a wisdom beard and not a pedophile beard. There's a fine line between the two haha.

@_calleja no. Grow a beard for wisdom instead.

@emlypie peach qualities would be the blurst, unless they look cool, if they look cool then it's not so bad.

@RachyVool ooh that doesn't sound like much fun at all, make sure you take it easy. He's doing well, checked out today, just very run down.

@emlypie yet, I bet tomorrow you'll bruise like a peach and everybody will want to poke it.

@emlypie ouch, hope it doesn't swell and bruise on you bro, make sure you look after it!

@WhiteLion_1 people whore for stars? Really?

@emlypie thanks bro, if I could marry anyone in a ninja turtle consume it would be you :)

@bertarii my boss said it's fine provided I come in for a full day tomorrow. I get a day off and I get more hours, it's win/win!

@gobbles21 also one saying "I don't have a girlfriend but I do know a girl who would be very angry hearing me say that."

@emlypie eh after the run our families had the last couple of years I now automatically go into organisational mode.

@ticktickticktic it's not good business that's for sure.

@emlypie he's checked out and home recuperating thankfully :)

@SuperTriviaGuy yeh it sounds like she's phrased it pretty poorly, there's a million ways to probe a price drop without being that blunt.

@SuperTriviaGuy it's just her probing for an indication you are either looking to sell for a lowered price or a quick sale. To be expected.

@SuperTriviaGuy If you've got a few spare hours read 'Negotiate to Win' by Jim Thomas, I cannot recommend it enough.

@SuperTriviaGuy It's a polite way of reminding her it's valued at the market listing price. In the mean time read up on how to negotiate ;)

@RobAblinger yeh #teamfollowback should be renamed to #teamlies

@GuidoTresoldi correct me if I'm wrong but don't the A-League already have campaigns against homophobia in place?

@jodz indeed, I love hearing people talk passionately about a niche subject they're right into.

@RobAblinger it's an arbitrary and artificially inflated number on the Internet, it means nothing. #teamherpes

@jodz oh no, I didn't mean to imply you were, you've approached it with an open mind which most people wouldn't.

@emlypie you were spot on, a minute later I got tweeted a list of people who follow back. The funny bit is most of them don't. #teamherpes

@jodz the uniqueness of people is what gives us diversity. Let 'em enjoy it!

@jodz "out of work computer programmer" yep, that's exactly the demographic I would have guessed are into My Little Pony.

@BirgitAspen1754 Also if you read my tweet I referred to you guys as 'herpes'. The fact you've popped up again only confirms this.

@BirgitAspen1754 you lie, only one of those follows as many or more people than follow them, the rest don't follow back. Stop lying.

@sullenhowler there's pretending and then there's pretending. This is the former and doesn't really do it for me.

@sullenhowler rumours of our level of touching have been greatly exaggerated.

@louhetrick chocolate covered things are ok though right?

@sullenhowler you, speechless? Get out, you must be ill or something :p

@emlypie your LOL to addiction ratio is pretty poor. Given how much time I spend outside your bedroom window you need to up your game.

@sullenhowler you look...I mean you feel...nice?

@emlypie so what you're saying is that I need an addiction to you? #ThisCouldEndBadly

@RachyVool and today you woke up with diabetes and a hangover. Seems like a fair trade :D

@jodz is your middle name 'corny' by any chance? :p

@jodz and love. There's always a lack of love.

@emlypie give up on everything, drop out of uni and take up a heroin habit. It's the only logical way to deal with everything :p

@andrew_54 oh ok, cheers mate.

@emlypie no cents for someone who doesn't make sense. It's only fair :p

@Halo_4 the human body has built up a tolerance against previous CPR procedures.

@emlypie your free advice is more helpful than your paid advice, I want a refund!

@emlypie for 54 cents I could have told you that :p

@emlypie haha I shall keep my shenanigans low key and stay fully sick.

@emlypie I've been getting progressively sick all week and now it's finally clicked over to fully sick mode. Urgh.

@pt_hippie I hear you, I'm hopefully shifting to the UK early next year to get out of this sterile place.

@miniblondeone that and the whole rape thing, or does that come under bad manners?

@pt_hippie so are you planning your next trip yet or what?

@sopharii good to hear, how long until he's back home? My things are good, not going as fast as I would like but I'm getting there :)

@WhiteLion_1 happy birthday bro!

@emlypie we can? Brb no need for twitter anymore!

@emlypie yep yep, he's only going to tell you what you want to hear because he wants more pics/to sleep with you.

@emlypie this is what I struggle to understand, you're putting your emotional happiness into the hands on guys who like you for your boobs.

@emlypie yep, surrounding yourself with people who only talk to you because of your rack is a surefire way to screw yourself up even more.

@welldonesimon never tried. There does seem to be an abundance of women on here who think this way though.

@emlypie you've hit the nail on the head. If people I've never met on the internet think I'm attractive I must be a good person.

@emlypie I don't know, you should ask one of the neverending stream of women who seem to follow this logic.

@welldonesimon i use the natures own multi vitamins, I don't know if they're better/worse than others but no complaints from me.

@BrettMWalters that's a great initiative, brb getting rich off sponsors.

@GotarBender hey you wanna go feed that donkey some beer? Get it all messed up?

@emlypie I have random days off during the week as well if that helps scheduling, that way we can play all day!

@emlypie because I have a terrible memory for remembering important things. As I said let me know when it's sunny, I'm down like a clown.

@emlypie I had totally forgotten about that. Lemme know when it's a sunny Sunday and you're on!

@GotarBender what is a horse shoe? What does a horse show do? Are there any horse socks? Is anybody listening to me?

@emlypie you're drunk and without clothes on a Thursday night? Did I mention we should hang out more haha.

@emlypie Mum's gonna be so mad when she finds out you've broken curfew!

@bookshopaddict yeh second round sounds like a fair trade to me.

@voose_lagina well that's it, you may as well just give up on life and call it a day now :p

@bookshopaddict no wonder they're pitching him directly. Not sure what the compensation rules state but they're too generous for him.

@bookshopaddict 150 games less him being dropped injured etc works out to approximately 7-8 seasons. It's possible I guess.

@voose_lagina haha that's awesome. Also replying to your tweet creepily fast again :p

@bookshopaddict if I were Essendon a second round draft pick would be enough, we wouldn't miss him.

@bookshopaddict as I said he's a list filler. The lack of key forwards for the Bombers hasn't helped their cause. (Williams, Gumbleton).

@pt_hippie you can always touch up with a fake one ;)

@bookshopaddict Apparently Melbourne have offered him a four year deal. He's 150 games into his career and yet to do....well anything really

@pt_hippie indeed, I'm looking forward to summer just as much, can't wait to swap jeans for shorts!

@_calleja yeh couldn't agree more, I've lost mates as a result of broken trust, if there's a rule in place you don't break it, no exceptions

@pt_hippie must say I do appreciate  sitting inside and hearing the rain pitter patter on the windows.

@White_Ox @white_wig only if she can sing the second verse of the national anthem. #Unstrayan

@nataliemoo you're one cat short of being a librarian haha.

@miss_invincible the best one I've found was the one I listed earlier. $20 for the ingredients and it should last me quite a while!

@_calleja yep, they're going to do it anyway so they may as well do it in a secure environment &amp; using protection. Ignoring it doesn't work.

@pt_hippie fave so far is the one I listed earlier, still toying with the exact formula though. Barely noticed the fast, time went quickly.

@bertarii oh is that what that was, I wondered why she kept tagging herself in my pics. The apple didn't fall far from the tree haha.

@bertarii ooh. Yeh he's useless.

@bertarii Joel? Nah he's only had one slip since he moved down here, he's doing well.

@PebblesHooper just be thankful he's not a vegan, you'd never escape then.

@sullenhowler ooooh ok. Perhaps return yourself and get a replacement under warranty?

@NatalieGaronzi why did one chicken castrate the other? Because the castrated chicken was a mother fucker. - Frued

@sullenhowler you can, just chase girls instead of guys. #easydone

@jodz or a skirt haha.

@jodz so a good day has just got better then? :p

@bortflancrest I've stayed out of jail my whole life. I don't choose this gang banger lifestyle, it chose me.

@emlypie I'll send some over ASAP!

@sullenhowler she won't let it go hungry though, once she realises you're not buying it food she will.

@sullenhowler so don't buy the cat food, she'll have to buy it then.

@LayLay_K if you're a millionaire you don't need to tell people, people already know.

@sullenhowler that way he can put money into it to build up a savings account but can't take money out of it unless I'm there as well.

@sullenhowler yeh I've since made him realise this. In exchange for the $10 I'm taking him to the bank tomorrow to open a 2 to sign account.

@sullenhowler it's for a work expense so I can't really knock him back. He's utterly useless though, no idea about life.

@LayLay_K haha or he could be a really nice guy, I don't know. That does seem a little strange to me though.

@LayLay_K he's clearly your stalker and he actually has 4, just in case you decide to start blocking him!

@pt_hippie I can imagine, complete contrast to the last few months. Worryingly he's 21.

@pt_hippie that's the biggest understatement of the year so far, he has no idea about anything unfortunately. All settled back in now?

@pt_hippie it's for a job related expense so I can't really say no. This is the same guy who quit both his jobs 2 weeks before rent was due.

@cpccpremiers09 it's good fun, the players like it, families like it, it helps promote the game &amp; gets better coverage. What's not to like?

@dookbaws he still uses IE doesn't he.

@lillybette7 indeed, no matter how good the sex is it's not worth it if the crazy continues afterwards.

@Rock87 Cahill/Henry are on $120k pw. Until we can match that the likes of Kewell/Fowler are helping promote the game in a big way.

@Rock87 past it doesn't matter though, they're still quality players and help the same way Henry, Cahill etc help promote the NSL.

@pt_hippie that's a solid 3 months of travelling yeh? Very jealous!

@miniblondeone I am a giant jerk and everyone hates me &amp; to be honest I'm surprised you've even looked at my profile. Feel free to block me.

Hey @pt_hippie are you still travelling the world or are you back in Aus?

@decobroad Dad was much the same, it has all those nostalgic connotations for you guys as well!

@louhetrick indeed, nobody wants to refute science haha.

@decobroad only a billion times, it's one of my favourite shows!

@louhetrick and I had to watch it because I needed to ensure it was of the highest quality. Also because science.

@louhetrick @idreamofcodeine haha you two crack me up!

@emlypie the nipples, the chafing, the minor tearing, it's a very I enticing prospect unless you're fully supported!

@idreamofcodeine surely someone has made a line of inexpensive running bras for women. I'm no marketing expert but that shit would sell.

@EatEmAliveTiger haha all I can think of is how much it must hurt and the long term effects :(

@louhetrick note to self: make running bras for every size. Profit.

@SarcasmFairy @mykimate it's written in size 10 down the bottom of the screen where everyone can see it, especially the visually impaired.

@PurringGirl $120 sounds like a reasonable price but it's not quite the bargain it was at $66.

@PurringGirl shit yes, that's value for money!

Also the 10:50 train is running late. Nice job @metrotrains!

My favourite part about the @mykimate booths is that they don't give you any change, making it hard to top up if you only have a $50 note.

@sjhross much cow fun.

@bookshopaddict yep, if there's one club that overspend on their coaching department it's Collingwood.

@louhetrick half time Sydney 53 - Hawthorn 48.

@chetzone it's a real possibility, as is Freo beating the Roos.

@sullenhowler you need to get a coat rack for guests to hang their clothing on once they enter your house.

@EatEmAliveTiger I'm assuming that the Roos win but Freo belt Melbourne next week, giving them a high enough percentage to pip Carlton.

@EatEmAliveTiger even if the Roos win Carlton still need to best St Kilda and make up the percentage difference in the process.

@PurringGirl word! ;)

@sullenhowler rookie error right there, pants are vastly, vastly overrated.

@gerta38 they win one every six weeks or so to keep the moral amongst players up.

@grand_dalliance I like your rug, it really ties the room together.

@gobbles21 would rather see the AFL help North out given they had to write a cheque to Etihad at the end of last season.

@gobbles21 common sense, Collingwood have the highest attendance rate of all sides.

@SarcasmFairy they look amazing!

@teacuptempest @punkprat why aren't my towels ironed? What is this a concentration camp?

@RutegerJones ship it to do a pretty good job filling that void from what I hear.

@MyNameInNorway nope I was elsewhere. Did you have a good night?

@teacuptempest @chetzone I am a fountain of wisdom and my advice is wise and just. I am also a grade A bullshit artist.

@MyNameInNorway try crown casino, there was a ton of cops there fifteen minutes ago. #hectic

@teacuptempest @chetzone exactly, don't listen to her she clearly doesn't have your best interests at heart!

@BrettMWalters perhaps not $600 but up to $350-400 yeh defiantly. Could go the other end and sell them at $700+ to DJ's etc.

@BrettMWalters 1. Snap up the domain http://t.co/GGFSepwg 2. Make led suits 3. ????? 4. Profit!

@BrettMWalters that would be fucking awesome, I'll take one of each please!

@BrettMWalters if you do a good job I'll buy a pair off you!

@BrettMWalters $90 for led pants? They will pay or themselves in awesomeness!

@teacuptempest @chetzone a good wingman doesn't blame the person they are winging for, it means you've failed to spot girls he likes!

@teacuptempest stop being a shit wingman then!

@tanya2708 I'm not god yet, but thanks for the compliment :p

@tanya2708 it's a good thing you had someone double checking ;)

@EatEmAliveTiger one of the most underrated bands of all time my friend!

@benjini_ it gets worse, batman gains full mobility despite having no cartilage in his knee. #unbelievable

@EatEmAliveTiger Status Quo selling out? They would have to go down, down hill for that to happen. #StatusQuoHavrGoneDown

@EatEmAliveTiger all round good fun and the closest thing I'll ever get to the real deal in the case of Zeppelin and The Doors.

@EatEmAliveTiger rookie error, 'Mick' is as well in his red vest.

@missjessieleex haha I think everybody who's ever been to Revolver has regretted it the next day.

@middleclassgirl kindle touch looks much classier as it doesn't have buttons. It also means it's less likely to have issues as well.

@voose_lagina damn, I'll convert it to Vietnamese dong before I send it then, nobody accepts Vietnamese dong.

@raphec why yes, yes you can. You'll need to supply your own suitcase though, I'm not made of money you know.

@voose_lagina I'll send you some in the post. Good luck using it in your stores!

@Todsta6 for sixteen people? Highly likely!

@Todsta6 I'm guessing alcohol plays a big part in that budget.

@tanya2708 that's barely anything compared to some I've made for myself! Send 'em through and I'll knock it over this arvo.

@tanya2708 terrible camera angles and besides who wants to see a guys junk? It's all ugly looking.

RT @emlypie: @ITMISAF my friend and I once photocopied our butts and faxed to a random

RT @emlypie: @ITMISAF my friend and I once photocopied our butts and faxed to a random

@emlypie Dad had two fax machines at home for srs bsns stuff, I used to tell my brother I would fax him something and then fax "You stink".

@emlypie I had a VCR of Monty Python, surely that counts?

@emlypie it's probably been on Facebook a while but I dunno I rarely go on there. Pretty funny though.

@tanya2708 done deal, if you shoot through all relevant emails to my email address I'll compile it and send it back.

@miniblondeone I may or may not have made it up on the spot. It sounds like an interesting combination though!

@tanya2708 @Travinport I'll do it, I'm sick and twisted and enjoy making things like itineraries and budgets. #ConfessionFriday

@tanya2708 @Travinport takes all of 15 minutes to do one up yourself and you know it's spot on. Better to do it yourself IMO.

@miniblondeone you know what they say, "pink, coral and red, you're better off dead". #AlsoBlueAndGreenMustNeverBeSeen

@Travinport @tanya2708 I tried using it but found it wasn't compatible with some of my flight details etc.

@emlypie I'll light a bonfire to let the pidgeon know where to meet the pony.

@emlypie I'll send it via telegram on the Pony express.

@White_Ox indeed. Would you expect anything less from the TGA though? It's not the first time they've made an utterly bizzare judgement.

@_calleja welcome to the internet!

@_calleja this should help chill you out :P http://t.co/Bs8OvfOo

@_calleja furious Friday bro?

@White_Ox the kids as well, it's amazing how much difference it made psychologically to me as a child knowing I had taken my cough medicine.

@grand_dalliance Bonjourrrrrrrrrr you cheese eating surrender monkeys.

Friday's facepalm is provided by the TGA who have restricted use of cough &amp; cold medicine for children. http://t.co/48sms4O7 (c/o @white_ox)

@White_Ox "Cough and cold medicines offer only temporary relief of common symptoms." Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that their function?

@White_Ox you've got to be kidding? That's absolutely absurd. What's the reasoning behind the decision?

@White_Ox to be fair to the TGA there is plenty of people who exaggerate things such as demanding antibotics for the flu.

RT @bridgetneval: SHIT! So just purchased 4 tickets to Noel Fielding in Melbourne instead of 2. I can't afford that. Who wants one?

@louhetrick remember to make the lame joke of "wow time flies" when you cross over the international date line.

On hold to @medibank chasing up details they were supposed to call me back on Wednesday to provide. Nicely done Anna from Melbourne office!

@tanya2708 the gym is the only place white socks are acceptable.

@AmLizabeth babies are great when you can give them back at the end of the day :D

@ShortBlokeJosh indeed, I'll be somewhat cautious of wise monkeys in the future!

@emlypie sounds like I need to crash a nursing home on big sporting weekends!

@emlypie ah no wonder you're only feeling vomity then, had you watched the whole show you would currently be in an induced coma.

@miss_invincible I always imagined that, much like booking a flight, you put in your key criteria &amp; it generates results that match.

@emlypie uh oh, someone watched Big Brother earlier.

@BrettMWalters interesting idea. The MT one is just like monopoly except the board is a different shape and you can buy stocks.

@BrettMWalters it's an app though so you may have to download it/track down screenshots.

@BrettMWalters have a look at the Millionare Tycoon game board, it's like monopoly but built more like a city.

@BrettMWalters @emlypie I am open to this idea if you can come up with a practical way to impliment it.

@sullenhowler pretty self explanitory I would have thought :P

@emlypie so share it then! :p

@sullenhowler ok in return you need to be available 24/7 for cooking, cleaning, shopping and general miscellaneous chores. Done deal.

@sullenhowler ooh right, I didn't know we were doing that on twitter where everyone can see and may think I'm actually sexist.

@GraceBellavue it sounds like it will only make the reception worse.

@sullenhowler not at all, a man, impoverished child or even a well trained helper monkey could also become my personal assailant.

@teacuptempest I did like the apostrophe though but I have an inkling you added that in, no one graffitis with correct grammar.

@JuzZelig approximately one every 100,000 square km's or every 38,610 square miles depending on your preferred method of measurement.

@teacuptempest needs more comic sans :D

@sullenhowler there was nothing inherently sexist about it, I'm an equal opportunity employer.

@emlypie I like the way you think, let's do this!

@SuperTriviaGuy good luck!

@sullenhowler I'm not applying for shit, you're the one after a job you could be my personal assistant!

@tanya2708 silly Tanya, once you purchase Mayfair and put hotels on it you'll be rich!

@emlypie you would wanna be serious, I'm hanging out for a game haha. I'm the thimble btw.

@sullenhowler uh, what do you use your personal assistants for? And no, make your own damn sandwich woman.

@sullenhowler hire two, I need a personal assistant to assist me.

@RutegerJones I'm surprised Law and Order haven't run an episode based on this incident, it's got plenty of twists and turns.

@MyNameInNorway People will always criticise those who abstain from the norm and then praise the same people when they become successful.

@MyNameInNorway if they're content for mediocrity then who's to say they need to step into the unknown? That said I agree completely.

@LuluAttack @phobes shame, you're missing out on an otherwise decent film.

@phobes shhh you're giving away key plot points! @LuluAttack

@allthepie a couple of crossed wires and each with our own bias, we'll have to agree to disagree on this one I think.

@LuluAttack Assuming it was you I was talking to about gore films some time ago. If not then disregard as it will damage your life.

@LuluAttack if you get a chance check out 'A Serbian Film', it's August Underground and then some.

@allthepie at no point have I said "all porn" is invalid nor have I disagreed positive/respectful is different for everyone.

@allthepie "there is respectful porn out there" "bondage is highly respectful" "there is quality porn". Not sure where you got that from.

@allthepie porn can have a positive influence and be positively expressive I don't dispute that but that's a minority.

@allthepie but it does fly and there's an abundance of evidence to support it. http://t.co/XwYsBLkz.

@allthepie by and large the Internet as a teacher creates a very skewed perception of what is/isn't acceptable behaviour.
