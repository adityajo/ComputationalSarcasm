@rdapiran Did you run a PB?

Congratulations to @rdapiran on her 2nd place in the mums' longest kick comp at #Auskick this morning. Didn't quite nail the torp.

What, the B52's song? RT @RNDrive: Did you know "My Own Private Idaho" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry IV (pts 1 &amp; 2) &amp; V?"

Did a bbq tonight. For once didn't get swamped by European wasps. They must've all buzzed off home to check their bank balances. #eurocrisis

Did Terry actually say "more cleaner"? Mtâ€œ@SENfooty: Terry says the Tigers just look more cleaner than the Hawks during this 1st Qtr.

Did I mention my father's from Gweedore? #DunnanGallabu #GAA #allirelandfinal

Didn't know Rod Marsh was lead singer in Toto. #rage

RT @jimmyraynes: Did Sophie Mirabella just use the force to choke SImon? #qanda

@Meggsiola struggling to come to terms with #Barca losing o'night. Didn't expect that despite 1st leg result.

Perfect Christmas preparation day. Did the market run, mowed the lawns, had a swim. Pizza and beer for dinner. #wellearned

A belated but well-deserved pat on the back for #celtic for their effort against Udinese. Didn't get there, but did us proud.

Didn't see it last night, but agree in general. RT @henriettacook: great piece on a very stale #qanda by Mel Campbell http://t.co/KnHtJdBn

Did Kevin Rudd moonlight as the evil mayor in the new 'Yogi Bear' movie? A very natural, compelling performance.  #auspol

Did I just tune in to question time or ABC Kids? #qt
