@ITV gotta love a bit of Bridget Jones but it's a shame it's out of sync. #IngestProblems? #ITV2

Another miserable morning thanks to the rubbish @SouthernRailUK service from Streatham Hill.  Horse and cart would be more reliable.

"@emmerdale: Who in the village do you think is the vandal? RETWEET and tell us now! #Emmerdale." I reckon it's Edna, she's a secret rebel.

Grand total of 0 hours sleep last night and the party next door is still going strong no thanks to the @lambeth_council noise team.

@scott_mills is the Ann Widdecombe of this year's #StrictlyComeDancing

@OliviaObiWan she sounds amazing and could totally have been a "cheese game" winner

@Nikilourob not even kidding, I've got soo many ideas that would sort out a lot of this country's problems. Sogan "clean up your shit"?

@Nikilourob more like #LetsAllHibernate

"@Nikilourob: TGI's are doing their best to embarrass the Birthday girl.... And failing! @Julie_McAuley http://t.co/8A42EMcK"

@Nikilourob oh, I've got so much support behind me. When is the next election? #lolz

@DAISYBINKS may start a campaign.

@dalemoon90 I was impressed to say the least :) Missing your all round Dale-ness. You should come to my housewarming next month.

@dalemoon90 why does it remind you of me? Cause I'm a tramp? Or cause you sang it that time in the legendary #Birmingham

@ArchieLyons @daisybinks jeez Archie, you still drunk? Haha, Daisy said we met at halls, we were in the rooms opposite each other #Blenheim

@DAISYBINKS @ArchieLyons #NTU and talk about weird when we found out our b'days we on the same day a year apart

Off work for the next couple of days for the preparation and aftermath of the @SRA's. Exciting times #SRAs2012

Everyone should be watching #CrimeTV tonight @10 for the premier of @BritainsTaboos I've seen a lot internally, its going to be good #Taboos

@DAISYBINKS I pass it everyday, I work in syon lane at Sky and living in Croydon :)

@DAISYBINKS I've just passed through Barnes on my way to work :)

@Pete_Allison @billiambonz it used to be my ring tone, but I used to laugh so much that I couldn't answer the phone.

That awkward moment when you play a recording of @BilliamBonz saying "a group of pigeons has pooed everywhere" in the office... #newsweek

@catdeeley was it @antanddec who sang "we all love Cat Deeley, she smiles on our TV" during a kids breakfast show #oldschoolmemories

@tommcfly everyone loves a bit of toilet humour to brighten their day, @PoopingDinosaur fills that gap in the market #pooped

Yes I work for Sky and yes I'm writing up notes whilst listening to @justinbieber  catching up on all the new releases I missed #notashamed

@MsMelanieSykes always cutting to the point #bluntisbest

@EMTrains on the 14:24 from Notts, the announcements are loud + constant making the 2 hour journey frustrating #unhappycustomer#unnecessary

@kyle_tranter @TomWatts_ this year was tough considering how much 1st and 2nd was like sunshine and lollipops, no time for anything

@TomWatts_ start working on it now, I kid you not, third year creeps up on you from all directions really quickly. Have you got an idea?

@TomWatts_ I'm shocked! Although, good choice, third year is manic and you have Capital to focus on as well as the dreaded documentary.

@TomWatts_ I do miss Tom + Julie though on Wednesdays, maybe I'll make a guest appearance sometime...

@TomWatts_ you know my head was always in the clouds, loving it, great experience and the team is great. Congrats on getting the capital gig

@TomWatts_ never fear, I've seen it. Going to stick it out at SKY for a bit though, work my way up, ask Stephen Fry for some advice, thanks!

@carolineflack1 @radioleary Dermonts Quasimodo impression is more along the lines of a walrus, good attempt though...

@OliviaObiWan oh my favourite, although I too am currently using kleenex balsam for my snotty needs

This time last year I had a tan and was celebrating TrentFreshers with @Fly_FM, this year I have a full time job #sadtimes

Managed to catch a Celebrity Juice repeat last night and witnessed @example using a "pelvic wand". What a good sport #legend

@LidiaLowe my building talents don't stop at shoe racks, oh no, its on to bedside tables for me #shouldofbeenabuilder http://t.co/VNk9925z

@LidiaLowe "I am no angel" gets me everytime it comes on to my ipod. #singingsensation

@ArchieLyons no! This sounds amazing. We must do it when I have my life sorted out a bit, completely in over my head atm. Haha

@ArchieLyons gah, commuting is the bain of my life. Living in Croydon. Let's do it Labrinth.

@LidiaLowe oh no way! I've just had a cooked breakfast on the boss. #workbenefits!

@BilliamBonz this morning I had a croissant #feelingfrench

@AllyShipway thankfully I'm on a different train now. Her 5ish year old son was sitting watching her.

The thought of @Kadelac and @LidiaLowe in their canoeing attire give me endless giggles #shortshorts

@Kadelac see you later, I've made mars bar traybakes for yours and Jez' arrival. #chocolate

@ahoythererach its on site where my job is. Don't think a starbucks would give me motivation to do anything... Haha

@ahoythererach I get many benefits inc that and broadband and a gym membership (I think they are implying I workout more)

@ahoythererach aww yeah, yet another culture shock but its all good. Meet the Sky team tomorrow #excited

@AllyShipway thanks :) #curry

@ahoythererach west croydon, but a less dreary area. Lovely big 2 floor flat with a garden and everything.

@ahoythererach it is rather exciting. When I get settled in you'll have to come visit :) #cbjrepdreamteam

@LidiaLowe it was a precious moment when we were reunited. See you later homie #elephantwithnotrunk

@LidiaLowe I did it, I had chocolate and it was good #bounty

@MattRoulstone thanks Matt :)

@djpremz thanks #woo

@djpremz meeting the landlord tomorrow. Don't worry, when we are settled in we will have some people over

@djpremz Jez wouldn't go but I would. If we get this house we will be in West Croydon.

@djpremz aww yes! Where abouts in Croydon? I'd be up for going.

@djpremz no worries, easy mistake. Thanks m'love, now I'm in London I can come see you. Moving to Croydon.

@djpremz he's a great guy, not his niece though. I'm a cousin. #minor

@nickbooth5 all thanks to you Nick and I'd also like to thank the Corrs

@HelloTomWatts free sky, health care etc etc. Amazing!

@OliviaObiWan I saw a man today I thought you would like to be friends with. He loves straws #strawinabottle

@tomwatts101 oh dear.. That is bad. What conversations?

"@tomwatts101: @Julie_McAuley our memory shall forever live on in our podcasts for all to enjoy." - aww yeah

@tomwatts101 cooool. Can't believe Tom and Julie is over. I refuse to accept it.

@tomwatts101 aww really? Is it our last ever show cause it was a lot of fun.

@tomwatts101 this is why we were good together. #loveit

@harrypandey aww :( not to worry. Pizza was gooood #thanks How are you?

@harrypandey Yeah,I'm here hoping to getting a job and move to London. Going pizza hut now, woop! If you're still around you should join. X

@harrypandey hey, I'm good thanks. He's up in Notts at the moment but doesn't have Twitter... #oldman haha

@BilliamBonz accidentally favoured that tweet. But yeah, that would be a problem. #animalhospital

@BilliamBonz use a needle and thread and sew it back together. It will heal, unless its already dead...

@harrypandey interesting tweet to wake up to #prettyfunny

@OliviaObiWan in my excitement I wrote 'live' instead of "Liv" #boffin

@OliviaObiWan love it p.s. #shescomingbackonfridayyyyy

@nickbooth5 somehow managed to send a blank tweet maybe its a sign I should sleep.

@nickbooth5 I know right, he is now know as Darius Campbell though, I'm on a bit of a Darius hype right now #wewantDarius

Watching #thelastexorcism with @nickbooth5 is a mistake

@OliviaObiWan of course, might help me finish the essay off too. #happyeaster

@tomwatts101 nope never, thought it was just a mario kart thing/myth, this man was comical

RT @Pete_Allison: Please can we all do everything we can to ensure 'totes hilare' doesn't catch on

@OliviaObiWan tell you what, I'll text you, don't need the whole of twitter, including Sean Paul, what our plans are. Haha

@OliviaObiWan well I'm not going anywhere. What are you doing tomorrow, I have soo many stories about my weekend and we overdue a catch up

@ShakinStevensJr it was very good,I was impressed but on another note,the further North I went the more depressed I felt at the scenery #soz

@OliviaObiWan it was better than George's.Was in York earlier today,got to put on a bee suit and we sang a duet in the car. #toomuchlaughing

@justinbieber its my mum's birthday too #snap

@LidiaLowe my kids will all be in matching clothes holding those pointers similar to those in asda so I can always see where they are.

@Habster91 literally this woman had her children lined up with the father and took them one by one to the toilet. Was amusing to watch.

@OliviaObiWan good luck today with your #sportrelief mile. An inspirational song would be "keep on running" LOVE YOU xx

@AndyLawrence I know, now I have to express it in very few characters #itsnotenough

@AndyLawrence that was only one thing, there was 2 other things happened before. The irish man one was the funniest of the lot

@OliviaObiWan thanks Liv, feeling more like myself today so I'm not sure who I've been feeling like for the past few days... #curious

@Nikilourob you tweeted :o #welcome

@Pete_Allison its funny cause you are blatantly trying to hold it together and not laugh.

@Pete_Allison just relived the pigeon 2 way, I think environment correspondent could be a career path for me

@kyle_tranter I didn't even pester him. Just a few tweets here and there. Too funny though

@rochellebalboa just got to check my followers, he was number 99. Ahha

@AnnaMay58 hard at work @Fly_FM http://t.co/q170DOYt

@OliviaObiWan literally just saw your original tweet. I so know the pen you are on about # JEALOUS

@OliviaObiWan I literally have no idea what you are going on about. Lmao.

@OliviaObiWan umm, am I meant to know what you're on about. Myself and @BilliamBonz are in the library working away.

@leannemumby I know, it made my day. I love OTH.

Was so good to get a glimpse of the talented @antwon_tanner in OTH last night. Skills should be featured more &lt;3

@LidiaLowe @BilliamBonz. You would not believe how much I laughed. I had to walk away. He said it so funnily.

@BilliamBonz "who's gone and drawn a willy on the table?"

@LidiaLowe @OliviaObiWan I will be in anyway to put together all my stuff for hand-in.

@OliviaObiWan @LidiaLowe that's cool. Ill be there. Fun times await. Lol.

@OliviaObiWan I'm going to be in the library from 2ish. Let me know when you plan to join later. @LidiaLowe may come too.

@LidiaLowe woopsies. I shall re-do it so liv gets it too. I'm planning on spending most of the day there. Probably be in around 2ish

@LidiaLowe ill forward you and liv the link. I'm sure we can make it less expensive.

@LidiaLowe I'm thinking a spa day would be good for a bit of de-stress after all this palaver.

@LidiaLowe hmmm, penny saving should be on my mind. Saving for a shopping spree in belfast. Been making itinerary for us. #excited

@LidiaLowe hahaha, I know right. Good ole belvita, haven't seen them gracing your lips in a while.

@LidiaLowe yea, wouldn't risk it for the biscuit, unless it was a yorkie, in that case you would give your life. Haha

@LidiaLowe aww that's a good percentage. Well done. Is it defo not coming up in the exam?

@LidiaLowe I swear I'm studying to be a journalist, so I'm taking it as a compliment now. Lol. How did you do?

@LidiaLowe got 58% which I'm happy enough about. He complained I was too journalistic in some of my paragraphs....

@LidiaLowe got it back. Internet has been shitty all day so took a lifetime to get to my email inbox. Lol.

@Kadelac that isn't fair, you got your essay mark? Mine was a corrupt file. I emailed him yesterday, still nuffin.

RT @JonahTop3: Leonardo Dicaprio's accent in Blood Diamond is outrageously good.
