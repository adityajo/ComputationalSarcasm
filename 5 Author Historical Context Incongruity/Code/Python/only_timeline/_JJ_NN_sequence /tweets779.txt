@EndNRA I am listening. Tell me more about what you are proposing. Twitter is a pretty poor debate platform.

@BruceEnberg @EndNRA @artofclasswar @mterry337 Victory by derision. #classic #youwinnowgoaway

@artofclasswar @BruceEnberg @mterry337 @EndNRA If that were true, then why do they still carry them?

@BruceEnberg @artofclasswar @mterry337 @EndNRA That is completely out of left field. Pay attention.

@BruceEnberg @artofclasswar @mterry337 @EndNRA It is because we have a long history of trying and failing to have rational debate.

@BruceEnberg @artofclasswar @mterry337 @EndNRA Care to show me where I either said or even eluded to that?  I didn't think so.

@EndNRA ... differences do not matter.

@EndNRA Which is 100% true. Your next move *should* have been to try to find another country instead of insisting that the border ...

@EndNRA No, the point about Mexico was valid. You decided to bring up Japan and I merely pointed out why Japan is not a good comparative.

@artofclasswar @BruceEnberg @mterry337 @EndNRA ... "If guns don't offer any possibility of defense, why do police and military carry them?.

@EndNRA ... we can continue. You really don't get the concept of rational debate. #sorry #peace

@EndNRA I am not going to block you - because you haven't been rude and I just generally don't block people. But I really don't see how ...

@artofclasswar @BruceEnberg @mterry337 @EndNRA There is a huge difference between an "assurance of safety" and the "possibility of defense".

@EndNRA No, you didn't rule it out. You just jumped tracked without acknowledging realities. Shift, dodge, etc.

@artofclasswar @BruceEnberg @mterry337 @EndNRA Please don't jump in unless you are willing to read the history of literally 100s of tweets.

@artofclasswar @BruceEnberg @mterry337 @EndNRA I never once made that claim. pay attention.

@BruceEnberg @mterry337 @EndNRA Wrong.

@EndNRA And that is just the last of many instances where you refuse to debate honestly and then shift the discussion.

@EndNRA .. them into the island nation of Japan. Do you remember that? You completely ruled out the possibility of any impact.

@EndNRA Remember, you wouldn't give any recognition to the idea that smuggling weapons into the US from Mexico is easier than smuggling ...

@EndNRA ... reason I wanted to see if I could get you to even consider being honest about a topic.

@EndNRA But you see, we got to this point because of a debate in which you would not admit to some basic points. That was the whole ...

@EndNRA It is exasperating.

@EndNRA YES!!!! I can absolutely blame you - for not knowing how to engage in a rational debate.

@EndNRA How is it a distortion???? You already admitted it was true? I don't understand you at all.

@EndNRA And it matters because that is what you always do in the middle of a debate.

@EndNRA You didn't disagree with the fact - it just took us way too many go around tweets to get you to admit what should be an obvious fact

@EndNRA I stated from the beginning that this was a test to see if it was even possible to debate fairly. The test is the topic. #ufailedit

@EndNRA I have wasted too much time with you already. #sorry #dontwrestlewithpigs (Meant in the proverbial form)

@EndNRA Nope, sorry. I won't do it. This exercise proved that you refuse to debate fairly. You will weasel and dodge and shift the topic.

@EndNRA ... incapable of having an honest, rational discussion about the merits of your end game.

@EndNRA False. You just stated early you advocate for gun regulation. That is your end game. This exercise has proved that you are ...

@EndNRA Both of those statements are 100% true - regardless of how frequently you or I think guns are used in either fashion.

@EndNRA Guns make it possible for innocent people to defend themselves and their families against stronger and/or more skilled attackers.

@EndNRA Guns in the hands of bad people make it easier for them to inflict harm on innocent people.

@EndNRA Obviously you think that - but the time to make that case is after you acknowledge the basics.

@EndNRA ... of contention. In order to do that - you have to be able to acknowledge facts that might run counter to your end game.

@EndNRA No, I think the purpose of debate is to either move one or both parties a little or to reduce an argument to the lowest points ...

@EndNRA I want to stop fighting you on basic truths just because you worry about the next step. I want building blocks on which to debate.

@EndNRA Hmmm - but you made me wear you down on it. I had to battle you for like 20 tweets and reassure you about the context.

@EndNRA The same can be said for the 1st statement - but I was willing to go on record and tweet it anyway.

@EndNRA And that until you are able to have honest dialog, rational discussion cannot occur.

@EndNRA My point is that you cannot admit guns are used protectively - that they can enable the weak to defend against the strong/skilled.

@EndNRA Right now, I am only trying to see if it is even possible for us to have an honest discussion - and you are proving that it is not.

@EndNRA ... still willing and able to agree that point #1 is true - because I have intellectual honesty.

@EndNRA And that is how we differ. I advocate that guns are used protectively much more frequently than destructively - and yet I am ...

@EndNRA BINGO! Which is why you are unwilling to admit *anything* no matter how true if you fear it harms your advocacy.

@EndNRA ... who are alive today solely because they, or a loved one, had access to a gun. Period.

@EndNRA That statement did not make that axiom. That is the purpose of further debate. The bottom line is that there are people ...

@EndNRA And you are full of BS.

@EndNRA ... statement is 100% every bit as true as the first statement.

@EndNRA No, No, No. If you can't build a foundation, there can be no further discussion. We can discus frequency all day. But the 2nd ...

@EndNRA You refuse to allow any room for common ground - any building blocks on which to begin a rational discussion.

@EndNRA That is where it becomes debatable - but the the absolute truth of the first statement. And this is why I cannot debate you.

@EndNRA In some circumstances -absolutely. Just like there are some circumstances where 1st statement may not hold true.

@EndNRA It makes no statement of overall risk vs benefit, frequency, advisability - solely that it enables defense. It is unequivocally true

@EndNRA And that is the sole declarative of the statement - that a gun makes defense possible in situations of strong assaulting weak.

@EndNRA The same reason the first point is a fact. Why isn't the second point a fact?

@EndNRA That statement did not offer frequency, efficacy or advisability. It just stated the fact it makes it possible. Where is the myth?

@EndNRA Yep. I figured as much. You are incapable of acknowledging any fact, regardless of the truthfulness, if it doesn't fit your agenda.

@EndNRA Guns make it possible for innocent people to defend themselves and their families against stronger and/or more skilled attackers.

@EndNRA Guns in the hands of bad people make it easier for them to inflict harm on innocent people.

@rynicole01 Not made up: http://t.co/FqEAg9CMvZ Sorry, I thought you must have been following the debate at least a little. #research

@gaia21 Nearly all WA sheriffs disagree also. The are opposed to it because the vague language makes it unenforceable http://t.co/FqEAg9CMvZ

@rynicole01 That is why nearly all WA sheriffs are opposed to it - it is unenforceable and it will end up in the courts.

@rynicole01 And it is not a silly argument. It is a real issue. The wording is so vague as to cover nearly transfers.

@rynicole01 I don't have a problem with smart, limited expansion of BGC's. I do have a problem with poorly written, falsely advertised laws.

@gaia21 You realize this poorly written law will make it a crime to simply hand someone your weapon, like at a shooting range?

@CruzWhobris @BruceBartlett Using the lowest estimates available for defensive gun usage, it is about 15 defensive uses to every 1 death.

@CruzWhobris Exactly! That is indeed the only thing they have in common. Unlike Ebola, guns are frequently used to protect life. #gunsense

@EndNRA I'm frustrated that you keep trying dodge the original assertions. The discussion cannot move forward until those are addressed.

@EndNRA But is regulation solely responsible for thugs not using mines in common criminal activities? Seriously? Wow!

@EndNRA Again. Mines &amp; guns R two different entities with different uses and different demand patterns. Does regulation play a part? Sure.

@EndNRA You display no ability to perform critical thinking skills or the intellectual honesty to have a reasoned debate. #imdone

@EndNRA Which is why our discussion never work. You simply refuse to admit *anything* at all contrary to your indoctrination.

@EndNRA 

@EndNRA I could bring up the bristling illegal arms trade in Russia despite strict gun control, but you will choose to ignore it.

@EndNRA Of course you would want to make that comparison, because it defies logic to do so and because you *think* it supports your point.

@EndNRA I just haven't been able to decide if that is by choice or not.  But it is *extremely* frustrating. #peace

@EndNRA No, my points are not getting absurd. Your response are - but I think it is because you are not following my conversation.

@EndNRA ... demand for bazookas and land mines because they would not do the CRIMINAL any good in a home invasion or for other crimes.

@EndNRA Where does bulk of drugs come from? 90% of cocaine in US comes from Mexican drug cartels. Drug trade into US is $10 BIL industry.

@EndNRA Even if that stat were true, and it is not, it doesn't matter. The demand for guns by criminals will always be extremely high.

@Lithobolos @kharyp What? Did you mean "If there were *no* searches"

@Lithobolos @kharyp Much much more reliable way to sneak a weapon than to hope for complacency and risk being caught.

@Lithobolos @kharyp True. But they don't have free open access every minute of everyday except the event to pre-plant a weapon in a bathroom

@Lithobolos @kharyp ... a higher likelihood of actually creating a "gun-free" zone at courthouse than U ever will at a one time Univ event.

@Lithobolos @kharyp "They are always active because the threat is always high." I understand that. My point was that because they are ...

@EndNRA And the answer is absolutely yes. Landmines do not fit that category. Criminal are not likely to seek illegal sources for landmines.

@EndNRA The topic is: are new restrictions to widely owned and readily available weapons similar to alcohol and drug prohibition laws?

@EndNRA Land mines are not frequently used to defend from criminals - so again, you are using a poor comparison and shifting the topic.

RT @Nicki_F: Conversations with #gunsense dumbasses. http://t.co/o6IB18hjtN

@Lithobolos @kharyp That is true. But, courthouse checkpoints are always active. Much harder to hide a weapon somewhere before hand.

@Lithobolos @kharyp I think it likely came down to not wanting to pay the expense and they used RTC law as a scapegoat.

@Lithobolos @kharyp I think that is crap. One does not prevent the other. They manage this at Texas Capital building everyday.

@Lithobolos @kharyp I disagree. I it not about someone else's perception on need.

@EndNRA No. But landmines have never been readily available. AR-15's have been, just like alcohol was before prohibition.

@SKBots So let me ask you. What is your proposed solution to deal with gun violence in America? How would you fix it?

@SKBots Do you know what oxymoron means? Because I don't really see it. And I don't see what it has to do with wasting days. #sorry

@SKBots You are the one just told me you live in irrational fear in the US ... lol. Who is the one wasting beautiful days?

@EndNRA You are telling me the various assault weapons bans that have been proposed and enacted don't have any resemblance to prohibition?

@SKBots I am not wasting anything. I am not wasting any time. I enjoy everyday as much as you do.

@SKBots That is an irrational fear. It is not based upon data. It is akin to preferring to travel by car than plane in spite of the data.

@SKBots ... I merely feel unprepared.

@SKBots ... just being a realist. There are times, by law or or by choice, when I am not armed. When this happens, I do not feel scared ...

@SKBots I agree. I guess we just disagree on what is rational. You assume because I prefer to be armed that I am afraid. But I say I am ...

@Lithobolos @kharyp But what do the threats have to do with whether or not vetted and licensed individuals should be barred from carrying?

@Lithobolos @kharyp I do love that quote ... "The perfect is the enemy of the good."

@EndNRA The point is the #guncontrol is simply another variant of prohibition law - subject to the same failures as the rest.

@thatswhatsup333 @LTCFBurns @dkabrams51 @HerbertjeJames @lionhart32 @JanOstrowski3 @ZeitgeistGhost Here is my theory: http://t.co/j63uBy4q1V

@thatswhatsup333 @LTCFBurns @dkabrams51 @HerbertjeJames @lionhart32 @JanOstrowski3 @ZeitgeistGhost The point is they will grow out ignorance

@kharyp That could be dozens of times in a single trip. I-594 is unenforceable. That is why sheriffs association opposes it.

@kharyp But what if you know all three. Every single time a gun is handed to someone and then back again would require an FFL BC.

@kharyp Touché. But I still think education is more important. Kids in car seats was won with education, not legislation IMO.

@thatswhatsup333 @LTCFBurns @dkabrams51 @HerbertjeJames @lionhart32 @JanOstrowski3 @ZeitgeistGhost Lol. Wisdom comes with age.

@kharyp Plus, some homes have no children visiting.

@kharyp Again. Cars are different. There are few situations where unbuckled children are safe. Well trained kids use firearms all the time.

@kharyp How about the formerly legal gun owners in CT and NY in danger of losing firearms due to registration?

@kharyp What do you know about WA state's I-594? Did you know it makes it a crime to hand a friend your gun at a gun range?

@kharyp In this area, I think education would be far far more successful than legislation. There is no one size fits all household.

@kharyp UBC's come with unintended consequences. I support *some* expansion of BCs. But have to be done intelligently &amp; w/ focus on rights

@kharyp ... the difference between liberty and security to show that they cannot be used interchangeably.

@kharyp In most states the same is true carrying. But we can only take the cars to guns comparison so far. I was primarily highlighting ...

@kharyp ... recklessly is not taking away anyone's liberty. They are, however, impacting other's safety and security.

@kharyp Liberty is given away by restricting how we can drive. But not completely removed because we still can drive. Someone driving ...

@kharyp That is a clear trade off of liberty for security that we are all happy to make everyday. But note the lines and definitions.

@kharyp Driving is a privilege. We limit our liberty to drive in any manner we choose for safety. We can't drive on right side of the road.

@kharyp You didn't specify open carry.  So we may not disagree as much as you think. But it is still not infringement on liberty.

@kharyp I could point you to statements by founders that, I think , make intentions clear. But I think we have both been down that road. :)

@kharyp Under most circumstances, absolutely not. They may view it as a perceived reduction of security, and that might be a valid view

@kharyp I don't know how we have shifted to open carry. The constitution protects the right 2 bear arms. It does not state manner of bearing

@kharyp By choosing not to carry, you have not relinquished liberty. When prevented from bearing arms by statute, it is a different story.

@kharyp We have the privilege of operating a motor vehicle, not a constitutional liberty, but still a liberty that demands responsibility.

@kharyp How is it absolutist? We have liberty to speak freely, but does that not also bear the burden of doing so responsibly?

@SKBots And statistically, guns in the US are used protectively far more often than destructively, even by the lowest estimations.

@SKBots I'm not scared. But pretending bad things don't happen in the world is not helpful either.

@kharyp In every situation imaginable,  responsibility comes fully intertwined with liberty. There is no separating the two.

@SKBots So guns are never used protectively? Is that what you are saying?

@EndNRA The larger point is the prohibition type laws have never proven very successful. Education works far better than legislation.

@EndNRA The smaller point is to correct, what I feel, is your huge misunderstanding about the war on drugs. I would encourage U 2 look it up

@Lithobolos @kharyp ... and it can only be threat reduction. They will not achieve threat elimination.

@Lithobolos @kharyp I don't see how I argued against this. Threat reduction is fine. It just could have been done with or without RTC ...

@kharyp I don't see how it can't be a liberty issue. To me, governments limiting ones actions are precisely liberty issues - by definition.

@kharyp For me, that article comes down to insisting that everyone's liberties would need to be slashed in order to gain zero extra security

@kharyp We all do it, on a daily basis. We all make value judgements about how much liberty we should be willing to lose to feel safe.

@kharyp It still comes down to a lack of security in which you are willing to trade other's liberties to obtain.

@kharyp Fair enough. But preventing liberty is still the wrong concept to describe fearing for ones life - even when fear is justified.

@kharyp Classic liberal mistake, confusing liberty for security (or perceived security). We know what Ben Franklin had to say about that ;)

@kharyp True, that is my perspective when I think the entire situation through and look at the crime statistics for licensed carriers.

@kharyp I will be knocking off soon.  Thank you again for the civil discussion. #peace

@kharyp And I would say that is because you immerse yourself in one side of the debate and one set of figures.

@kharyp Agreed! I am not arguing otherwise. But all things being equal, I will opt for the path with the greatest personal liberty everytime

@kharyp RTC was the excuse they used. I am asking you to look at the situation and see her risk would be the same either way.

@kharyp I don't disagree with that. But I also despise security theater. I would rather not be fooled into thinking I am safe.

@kharyp "If the speaker felt unsafe then she felt unsafe due 2 gun violence threats" Agreed - and no amount of prohibition would eliminate

@kharyp I am not saying she was not in danger ... just that RTC laws did not make it any worse.

@kharyp There is essentially no way to enact a true prohibition. The RTC laws had zero impact on her safety at that talk.

@kharyp I work at a university. Campuses are *very* open to traffic. It would be a piece of cake to sneak a gun in and hide it days before.

@kharyp You do realize that people get guns past metal detectors just about everyday, right?

@kharyp They didn't need to prevent full prohibition - just prevent unlicensed gun carriers.  Just like is done daily at Texas Capital.

@kharyp That reply is not rebuttal to my statement. IOW, I agree with your reply, but my statement is still valid. Nothing to do with RTC

@kharyp ...but I do begin to get sarcastic when it seems like someone is avoiding logic or intentionally dodging the obvious. #sorry

@kharyp I like to debate because it narrows two differing opinions to the lowest points of contention. I can tolerate opposing points but..

@kharyp Again. Right to carry laws did not have to prevent metal detectors from being placed.

@kharyp Right. But the key here is that someone wanting to kill her with a gun won't care if guns are banned. They will not care.

@kharyp I am sorry, and thank you.

@kharyp It is called critical thinking. But fine, look through it to the other side.Why would a no carry sign stop someone intent on murder?

@kharyp ... the decision against detectors was a financial one. It has nothing to do with right to carry laws.

@kharyp I agree. Metal detectors are independent of legally carrying citizens. The Texas Capital building is a good example. I suspect ...

@kharyp So yeah, I thought you must be joking or just trying to be so absurd in order to just end the discussion.

@kharyp Why on earth would a person pay hundreds of dollars and hours of training to get a licences to legally carry in order to murder?

@kharyp I do try, I am not perfect. Sorry if I offended you. I really can't see how that made any sense.

@kharyp I want you to try to explain why you think she would be more at risk at that venue than in a state with no right to carry.

@kharyp Yes. That is exactly what I want you to do!! Why is that too much too ask?

@kharyp I am followed by many liberals, and vice versa, because I like calm rational discussions.

@kharyp Then you are not familiar with me at all. I like to have reasonable, rational discussions with those holding opposite viewpoints.

@kharyp I get all of that. I understand the death threats and I would never take them lightly. I am just asking you to THINK it through.

@kharyp I am honestly just trying to understand you logic. I am completely baffled.

@EndNRA I made my point. Rational observers would agree with me. You just refuse to.  I am pretty sure we have been around this mountain.

@kharyp He doesn't care about committing 1st degree murder, but he cares about breaking a gun ban ordinance. That is what you are saying?

@kharyp He/she wants to shoot her, so he wouldn't dare sneak a gun into a venue where legally armed citizens are told they cannot carry?

@kharyp I think your obviously lack of critical thinking in this thread has got to be a joke. Seriously - it doesn't even make sense.

@kharyp lol ... you can't be serious

@kharyp So a person wanting to harm her *would* go through the trouble to legally carry a gun into the venue to then illegally murder her???

@SKBots It is only obsolete if you fail to realize that guns are often used protectively and ebola never is. #guncontrol

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy lol - you just won the internet!!!!

@kharyp That article is so absurd. If someone was going to harm her, they would not get a CHL in order to do it. #ludicrous #gunsense

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy I get that. Forgetting numbers for a moment. Guns are at least sometimes used protectively. Ebola never is.

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy BTW ... I really appreciate the calm, reasoned, and peaceful discussion.  #thankyou

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy That is obvious. I am trying to stretch your mind a little. :) You can't compare guns to ebola. It doesn't work

@EndNRA So in your mind, you simplify war on drugs to just being war on pot.  But that doesn't make it true.

@EndNRA Yes it is. The war on drugs encompasses all illegal drugs, not just pot. But pot is the drug that really makes war look silly. ...

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy It is just like air bags. We can say how many people are killed in car wrecks, but have to estimate lives saved

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy It would still never be as easy as counting dead bodies.

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Maybe. Would have to be setup nationally &amp; then rank and file cops would have to make subjective determinations

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy ... it into the text of the police report. But there is no way to count it nationwide. Not like a dead body.

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy But even when it is reported, law enforcement agencies typically don't have a checkbox for DGU. It may make ...

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy I was just trying to show that analogizing gun violence/gun control to ebola is a very poor comparison.

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Can't find full text, but here peer reviewed non-Kleck study finding 989k DGU's / year https://t.co/mIG97dnRda

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Really? The vast vast majority of DGU's occur without a shot ever being fired. How can that be tracked?

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Link to 1994 CDC study. http://t.co/Jffnyng8R6

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Ohh, but that would work in ur favor, wouldn't it? Easy 2 count victims or crime. Much harder 2 count negatives

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy That's why I gave you the lowest estimate. 500k from 1994 CDC survey - so you wouldn't choke.

@EndNRA @GregCampNC Because pot is the easiest drug to show futility of overall war on drugs. I think U are confusing it with the actual war

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Many estimates are as high as 2 mil times per year. So yeah, thousands of times a day.

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Yeah. Even the lowest estimates put DGU's at 500k per year. One was 1994 CDC study under Clinton.

@EndNRA @GregCampNC Hmmm.  Wikipedia disagrees with you: "illegal psychoactive drugs" http://t.co/jzNF9tEziE

@scaruso5555 @Seattle_Cowboy Hmm ... Could it be because Ebola is not used to protect lives thousands of times each day? #gunsense

@EndNRA @GregCampNC Really?!?! Lol. That's why the war on drugs has been deemed to be such a great success over the past several decades.

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals Projection much? Taking the opposite extreme of a presented extreme is not false equivocation.

@TJReinhart If you are taking tasks with his nomination being blocked - you have a lot of history from both sides to deal with first.

@TJReinhart ...it a much easier argument to block. IE Not only is he a political pawn for O, but he is not even a good candidate for the job

@TJReinhart Both. But concerns over his political past and activist tendencies are the primary driver. His lack of qualifications make ...

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals Not a fallacy. Your implication was that nomination and confirmation are only qualifications required.

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals Somewhat true. But one can't decry political motivations for blocking a politically motivated nomination

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals I think anyone who has served a high role will have a vested interest in his/her successors.

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals I was replying this tweet "Dr. Vivek Murthy Should Be Our Next #SurgeonGeneral" ... also an opinion.

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals Murthy's nomination was nothing more than quid pro quo for his support for Obama http://t.co/7btPSEVvcU

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals He is simply not qualified: http://t.co/Tj6vWuU726

@TJReinhart @kharyp @filthyliberals It points to Murthy being chosen by O due to his activism rather than qualifications for the job.

@andreajmarkley If you want, we can shift the topic to this article. I can easily show flawed it is. But at least admit the topic change.

@andreajmarkley Why do you keep trying to shift the topic? I can only assume it is because you have no valid way to dispute my assertions.

@andreajmarkley Yeah, well my discussion with you has been less than stellar as well - but it is pretty typical from most "control freaks".

@andreajmarkley That's what I said. They don't generally do that but are still useful in understanding the issue better.

@EndNRA No sir! "War On Women" is not a result - it is a motive. "Opposing Obama because RACIST" is not a result - it is a motive.

@EndNRA Here is an interesting study on conspiracy theories on the right and the left: http://t.co/cJ9hq9SmWJ

@EndNRA Funny - most people agree Romney won the bulk of the debates. It didn't matter though - cause O has the machine.

@EndNRA The Obama political machine coupled with media support is a pretty powerful locomotive - no doubt!

@EndNRA But while Alex Jones and crew are only a tiny extreme fraction - I think most dems believe the Bush consip. theory.

@EndNRA I guess the biggest liberal consp theory I can point to is the idea that somehow Bush tricked worldwide intel agencies into WOMD rep

@EndNRA They don't plan to survive - they chose to leave. What happens to your sustainability when you lose your tax base?

@EndNRA You've got plenty that are just as bad - just in different ways and that are given more media time. Poverty Pimps like Sharpton

@EndNRA Yeah - you don't just have few - you have literally dozens of them: http://t.co/hfPY4S9C1g http://t.co/ogS9Ydzjih

@EndNRA Of course it is - because you say it is and that makes it so.

@EndNRA You forgot to make this opinion true by adding #fact to it.

@EndNRA Perhaps- but in EVERY example you ascribe the worst possible motives for the policy. That is what makes you biased and so so wrong.

@EndNRA You really just choose to ignore #facts that you don't like- don't you. http://t.co/Mmq4PFXGFS. Is CNBC lying for Rush and Beck too?

@EndNRA ...and every Dem policy opposed by GOP is benevolent and GOP are morons, liars and scaremongers for opposing them. #IUnderstandNow

@EndNRA Essentially, what you have taught me is that every GOP policy opposed by liberals has evil intent so all tactics are justified ...

@EndNRA C... is currently using gun registration records to force citizens to give up guns. It just isn't happening anywhere. Right?

@EndNRA Using WarOnWomen is correct term and not remotely similar this scare tactic- because  no state in the US ... http://t.co/BoEMYpmiLI

@EndNRA So calling efforts 2 restrict abort. (most Americns support some restrictions- but just the stupid 1s) WarOnWomen isn't scare tactic

@EndNRA Then they will advocate for FGM to keep those evil sex drives at bay just like Islamic Fundamentalist that pro-lifers admire so much

@EndNRA ... access to all reproductive health services. Next step is kicking girls out of school and giving them away for marriage at 14.

@EndNRA ... about reducing the number of babies aborted (including the 51% female babies) they just want to control women and limit ...

@EndNRA Your right - WarOnWomen is the most accurate and least scare tactic way to describe the pro-life movement. They don't really care...

@EndNRA in fact, I think all laws should be passed under the rule "you have to pass it to see what's in it". Don't you? That's transparency!

@EndNRA but I forget. the benevolent ones know better than we. We are just supposed to trust their judgement &amp; not read the laws they pass.

@EndNRA If you do not give the public time enough to digest what is in it, then it is not transparent to the People you are representing.

@EndNRA If you are not given enough time to read it - before you have to vote on it, it is not transparent by any definition . #fact

@EndNRA That "Government Deficit" inc. increasing output and primary expenditures is listed as a cause is GOP lies: http://t.co/5avKItzQqq

@EndNRA And socialized medicine could not possibly have played any part in the initial Greek crisis because it HAS to be sustainable!

@EndNRA This has got to be a Rush/Beck lie! http://t.co/XzwoPYSIDG

@EndNRA And we know better than to believe reports of health care crisis in Greece because we didn't add #fact to it http://t.co/pP8aly46CH

@EndNRA What does democratic constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley know anyway. He is not really a dem - he was bought and paid for by Rush

@EndNRA And while he is at it- just go ahead and completely destroy the concept of separation of powers. It is outdated and no longer needed

@EndNRA It was completely appropriate for Obama to promise the most transparent govt in history and then implement the least transp one.

@EndNRA ... to know what is best for us. Good laws always start with unread bills passed behind closed doors.

@EndNRA Of course - the benevolent wise ones press forward with socialism over the protest of the troglodytes because we are too stupid ...

@EndNRA Don't forget to add your #fact hastag to this to make it extra true.

@EndNRA Yeah- because you can't want to reduce the number of abortions without being a misogynistic asshole- it simply isn't possible right?

@EndNRA Your right - the dot com bubble is just a figment of my imagination fueled by Rush and Beck http://t.co/vsgqwazckw It didn't happen.

@EndNRA Nobody would think of leaving such a sustainable system like that - right?http://t.co/fMyM8dnTBg Hmm - must be written by Glenn Beck

@EndNRA And in order to pay for all of those socialized services - France only has to tax its people at 75% - of course that is sustainable!

@EndNRA Of course is sustainable. This article must have been written by Rush - full of GOP lies: http://t.co/iNr7nrDioF

@EndNRA The only anecdotes that matter are the ones that support your world view because you have added #fact to them - so they must be true

@EndNRA You know, your right. I can only show you the anecdotes of Canada and UK that I showed before - and we know those don't matter.

@bran_hamilton @EndNRA Yeah - sorry. I was on a mobile device and the rest of your tweets had not yet arrived.

@bran_hamilton @EndNRA Ha dude, your hilarious. Did you read the study? It didn't say anything about smarts ... just bias.

@EndNRA and the US debt under Obama is at levels not seen before

@EndNRA It had everything to do with the internet and absolutely nothing to do with either party.,

@EndNRA Boom under Clinton was dot com bubble that burst a few years later. Reps also try to take credit they had congress - both are wrong.

@EndNRA If you can't see or admit that - then you truly have no interest in looking at things honestly.

@EndNRA ... you are so fond of - GOP is RACIST. If you oppose Obama it has to be because you are RACIST! Dems use fear to win elections also

@EndNRA I am not denying that GOP uses scare tactics. But Dems do it just as much. GOP will take away medicare, war on women, and the one...

@EndNRA That is total 100% BS.

@EndNRA No. Just trying to show one reason why you can't seem to see the forest for the trees.

@EndNRA I love how you claim something as a fact in spite of tons of contradictory evidence.

@EndNRA And this ... I think this really does explain why your view of the right is so warped. http://t.co/jH00MebxIg What do you think?

@EndNRA So again I ask What do you think your "Universal Background Checks" would accomplish?

@EndNRA It is simply unsustainable. Socialism always has been and always will be. It's simply math + human nature. It can't work. #period

@EndNRA 1. Correct. 2. Wrong. 3. Very wrong.

@EndNRA Wrong.

@EndNRA Real health care reform would start by addressing broken insurance system but not move so far toward single payer.

@EndNRA Socialized Medicine is fraught with problems worldwide, not anecdotes, but unsustainable. Should be feared.

@EndNRA The house trashed it because it was not even close to bi-partisan (or transparent) - it needed to burned and restart from scratch.

@EndNRA There were/are plenty of solutions to improve US heath care that don't involve socializing it - which WILL eventually break it.

@EndNRA But then did it by passing unread bill behind closed doors in cover of darkness - f*ck transparency? nothing good can come from that

@EndNRA you know - I didn't vote for BO- but there were a few things he said he would do that I was excited about - fixing health care was 1

@EndNRA Maddow is between O-Reilly  and Beck ... hows that?

@EndNRA Here is a take from a Canadian Doctor: http://t.co/RqLHKfB0oM This is the perfection you want to push on the US?

@EndNRA Yeah - Moore is pretty much they same Jones. Enjoys the perks of the systems he derides. Uses psudeo-documentaries to push agenda.

@EndNRA Don't try to give me Alex Jones - even Beck says he is crazy: http://t.co/8giaNZzgtr

@EndNRA Please. I just gave you several places where it is not.

@EndNRA And "whipping hysteria" is not the same as "faking a pretense". If you would cease exaggerations, we might be able to get somewhere.

@EndNRA I am not blaming others singularly - I am blaming them all. The #fact is that everyone believed the intelligence. #period

@EndNRA What does this tweet have to do with "universal background checks"? #confused

@EndNRA And before you tout france - here is a pretty honest comparison of pros and cons http://t.co/strr4Uw09h

@EndNRA More http://t.co/PBLCwPeW7U

@EndNRA Look - I am all for making things as fair as possible - but the systems you advocate for are simply not sustainable!!!

@EndNRA Because it is not always better ... http://t.co/QF3EczDarg http://t.co/aAwsTq8R6p

@EndNRA And it is not a dodge - I was specifically addressing this tweet - showing that the left has its own freaks. http://t.co/5MA2k3RYrJ

@EndNRA We have already been over the fact that just about every Dem also believed the intelligence community - they didn't fake it.

@EndNRA So you list "universal background checks" as a common sense reform? What do you think that will accomplish?

@EndNRA No comment?  Ok. I was going to avoid this because of your obvious bias and lack of effort to actually debate ... but I'm a sucker.

@EndNRA Failing to acknowledge problems in health-care - as well as violent crime - in your perfect role-model nations is extreme.

@EndNRA Uhh - last time I checked, Hannity, Beck, O-Reilly are all TV hosts. Seriously dude- you are the worst about twisting the argument..

@EndNRA Seriously dude? I think you have fallen off a cliff. We would be in far shape if left extremist had their way than right extremist.

@EndNRA Don't give me that - you responded to the other tweet sent at the same time (although not honestly). #nicetry

@EndNRA No answer? Just as I thought. Zero integrity and zero intellectual honesty. Your witch hunt for bigots needs to start in the mirror.

@EndNRA Yes, of course. But "typical liberal logic" is no less bigoted than "GOP is party of ignorance" - is it? #intellectualhonesty

@EndNRA So you just completely dodge this.  #waytogo

@EndNRA No - it means equal opportunity should be guaranteed, but equal outcomes cannot possibly be guaranteed.

@EndNRA Wow! Nevermind. There is no hope of having a polite, rational discussion with you. You are the very definition of the word bigot!

@EndNRA Wow! #seriously Look at what you just tweeted yesterday compared to today.  #smh http://t.co/7d8J1xO0KQ

@EndNRA I know too many libs who call themselves independents to believe this is true. We will have to disagree on this point.

@EndNRA So, yes- a small percentage of GOP and TP are racist (just like dems) but opposition to BO policies is strictly on the merits.

@EndNRA And if either Cain or Keyes had won GOP bids for pres - you can bet you salary racist opposition would would come from dem party.

@EndNRA #notfact There is a fringe element to be sure but teaparty has endorsed dozens of black candidates:

@EndNRA In other words, dems think their pet policies r helpful but cons think same policies r harmful. There is nothing racist about it.

@EndNRA I completely disagree. The same policies libs *think* help minorities arguably perpetuate poverty and govt dependence.

@EndNRA Let's hold on the GC discussion just long enough to wrap up the 'racist' line - its too hard to tweet multiple threads.

@EndNRA What measures to you consider "common sense"?

@EndNRA Ok - I can see that connection ... but it seems pretty tenuous if you ask me.

@EndNRA I don't see it that way at all. Plenty of liberals are fed up with the Democratic party as well.

@EndNRA Your tweet had nothing to do with policy outcomes and everything to do with Obama's skin color. http://t.co/xJqwz04Ahk

@EndNRA ... that's why I finally resorted to blaming 'liberal logic' ... the racist label in that context doesn't make any sense.

@EndNRA accusing someone racism for not liking chocolate pudding even when you learn they don't like vanilla pudding either ...

@EndNRA Thank you. BTW You should try debating with the folks on your side of the isle sometime. I promise you it is no better. :)

@rich_ie_haynes @EndNRA Yes - and true for studies touted by both sides of any given controversial issue.

@EndNRA These critiques do not always involve authoring studies contradicting said data and they are not always published.

@EndNRA They can, and are frequently, critiqued for methodological flaws and/or for make assertions not supported by the data.

@EndNRA Just because a study is published in a peer-reviewed journal does not mean it is devoid of any issues and can be taken as gospel.

@EndNRA However, I was a bit overboard to declare the study to be "thoroughly debunked" by this one blog rebuttal.

@EndNRA If you bothered to read his critiques and are honest - I think you would find them spot on.

@EndNRA Highlighting issues with methodology is a common practice. But as they are just critiques - they don't generate any study data.

@EndNRA As I said before: Critiques of peer-reviewed publications are not always peer-reviewed themselves.

@EndNRA You, apparently, don't logic too good either.

@DMiller99 So closing a 'gunshow loophole' only applies to a very small number of transactions at gunshows - which as I have shown ...

@DMiller99 ... just like they can from their homes. This applies as long as they are selling less than some number of guns.

@DMiller99 The 'loophole' is that private sellers (i.e. selling a family collection) can setup a table and make a private transaction ...

@DMiller99 All purchases from gun dealers at gun shows have to go through the NICS bckgrnd check process just like in stores, no exceptions.

@DMiller99 You really have only been hearing one side and are misled a bit. I hope you don't mind if I share with you a minute.

@DMiller99 Actual automatic weapons are very, very tightly regulated by the National Firearms Act of 1934.

@DMiller99 AR-15 and similar rifles are not automatic weapons. They are semi-automatic just like nearly every other gun

@DMiller99 ... pretend for a minute that it would have any measurable impact on crime.

@DMiller99 Now I personally think that if you have enough guns to rent a table at a show - you should have to do BK checks. But I don't ...

@DMiller99 And did you know that a 1997 of inmates who carried firearms revealed 0.7% of them got their gun from a gun show?

@DMiller99 More people were killed with hammers, clubs, and fists.

@DMiller99 Do you realize that in 2011, 323 people were killed with any kind or rifle - including what the media calls assault rifles?

@DMiller99 @InnocentAvenger Wow! You are literally the first lib that have tweeted who was even willing to acknowledge this. #nokidding #ty

@DMiller99 @InnocentAvenger But you are willing to admit that guns are also used to protect the weak and innocent?

@InnocentAvenger @DMiller99 The real bullshit is not even being willing to acknowledge that guns are used protectively every day.

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target  Don't forget - the suspect in the Cobb theater shooting was a retired police officer.

@debralynnlazar That is why the court narrowed the ruling to "closely held corporations" ... pretty wise move in my book.

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target I have daughters myself and statements like "I feel safe" make me cringe a little ... lol

@debralynnlazar And that is where you and I disagree. Citizens of this country should not be forced to pay for what they believe is murder.

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target You are young and I also meant it as "keep your guard up in life, feeling safe does not equal being safe" :)

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target  Sure. While I did mean it as in "just because a store says it is gun-free - the criminals won't obey" ...

@debralynnlazar I can see why Hobby Lobby owners - given their faith - may want to be on the safe side until it is more concrete.

@debralynnlazar Ok - that is news to me. However - it does look like this is a growing and recent area of research- some from Feb of this yr

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target   My advise still stands - in life - there is a difference between feeling safe and being safe.

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target  Ok, that one.  I didn't know the name of the theater. Thank you.

@debralynnlazar @dumbGOP Debra - I have always liked you before because, while we are opposed on issues - I found you to be truthful.

@dumbGOP @debralynnlazar That is why Hobby Lobby picked those 4 out of 20 methods - they are essentially abortions. #honesty

@dumbGOP @debralynnlazar  ... but rather abortifacient. The morning after pill is not a contraceptive - it does not prevent conception.

@dumbGOP @debralynnlazar But if you pay attention (or are at least honest) you would see that the concern is not contraceptives ...

@theonenamedashy @msnbc @Target  I'm sorry, the Cobb? I'm not familiar with that reference.

@roosnews1 @RoseGrdnCenter And a ton of info when he was senator: http://t.co/EbaNRvJf8G including ban on possession of handguns

@roosnews1 @RoseGrdnCenter Yes - it is on his website: http://t.co/mBWWQDtKff ... "Renew and strengthen the ban on assault weapons"

@theonenamedashy @AaronSeitsinger @murphyd221  @msnbc The error rate of police killing an innocent person is 11% vs 2% for armed citizen.

@Nikluk @nickpwing A 60 year old man getting repeatedly beaten by a group? His odds of surviving are not real great.

@LessGrumpy @Nikluk @nickpwing Mass shootings in UK were already very rare. Since gun bans, murder and violent crime are up in UK.

@Nikluk @nickpwing And you also dodged this question. Do you think the 3 incidents I mentioned should be counted as school shootings?

@Nikluk @jeffperryone @nickpwing And you are still dodging the question. Would you fire to stop an attacker knowing that it *could* kill?

@Nikluk @jeffperryone @nickpwing I wonder how many you don't see because they protected themselves from violence with a gun.

@Nikluk @jeffperryone @nickpwing ... but sometimes that is not enough and you have to fire. Even then - most times they survive

@Nikluk @jeffperryone @nickpwing You don't try to kill - you try to stop the threat. Most times just displaying the gun will do that ...

@Nikluk @nickpwing You are right! If not for the neighbor stepping in with a gun - the old man would likely be dead. Why dodge the question?

@jeffperryone @Nikluk @nickpwing But the point is that you would use potentially deadly force to protect yourself or your child if attacked?

@jeffperryone @Nikluk @nickpwing ... and a bat is pretty hard to effectively carry for protection.

@Nikluk @nickpwing You don't shoot 2 kill someone- you shoot to stop the threat and that sometimes kills. That is exactly what the police do

@debralynnlazar oops ... "keep women *from* advancing" ... i mean

@debralynnlazar ... women in some way? Do you think they are intentionally trying to keep women advancing in society? #honestanswer

@debralynnlazar Do you think Hobby Lobby doesn't want to pay for these pills and IUD's because they are misogynist and/or want to hurt ...

@debralynnlazar I want to ask a related question and I hope you will feel comfortable answering honestly. Forget the SCOTUS ruling for a sec

@nickpwing @Nikluk And to make said point - MDA will twist the data and mislead the public - because the ends justify the means?

@debralynnlazar Right or wrong - it still does not equal saying that the employee is not a person. Not even close.

@debralynnlazar Tough questions! But not forcing an employer to pay either of those would still not be saying the employee is not a person.

@nickpwing @Nikluk ... in a field behind said school. Nor is a college responsible when a gang shooting occurs off campus.

@nickpwing @Nikluk Then by your own argument - it is not 74 shootings. A school is not responsible when an adult is shot at 9:00pm ...

@debralynnlazar @bakerbk It would only be impacting 'rights' if SCOTUS in some way said women are not allowed to do something.

@debralynnlazar @bakerbk No. It only says that someone shouldn't have to pay for something they believe is morally wrong.

@nickpwing @Nikluk ... those incidents - they are not school shootings. It is not about feelings - it is about facts.

@nickpwing @Nikluk What school? At least two of the incidents didn't even occur on school property. It doesn't matter how I feel about ...

@bakerbk @debralynnlazar What on earth about this ruling can possibly be taken to mean women are not people? #seriously

@Nikluk @roosnews1 And even if GC has had a positive impact on crime in Australia - it appears to be the exception rather than the rule.

@Nikluk @roosnews1 ... but even that is not 100% clear: http://t.co/JtCiosBpcV

@Nikluk @roosnews1 Australia is the one country where I find some solid evidence to support crime reduction via gun-control ...

@Nikluk @nickpwing If you really think those incident qualify as school shootings - then I am afraid we will have to agree to disagree.

@Nikluk @nickpwing You think we should count when a student is shot by gang thugs while NOT on campus? http://t.co/mtlbyYfegd

@Nikluk @nickpwing You think we should count a student shot in crossfire when police chased a criminal onto campus? http://t.co/0JRM3OU7qT

@Nikluk @nickpwing So you think we should count 19yr old shot at night in a field behind an elem school? http://t.co/Ta6Emg48qt

@Nikluk @nickpwing I understand that. But again - if u are trying to make people picture 74 Sandy Hook style shootings - u r being dishonest

@Nikluk http://t.co/nOiKLaZIJp - You have to scroll down a little from that point.

@Nikluk (BTW - the number of fatal accidental shootings is between 2 to 3 a day).

@Nikluk Here is murder rates in the UK after their gun control measures ... US rates fell during same period: http://t.co/lvDZHE6Smc

@Nikluk Ok. what policies would you implement that would lower them? I already showed you one Harvard study indicating GC laws don't help.

@Nikluk @nickpwing I feel for her, believe me, but CNN isn't saying her son's murder doesn't count- they r saying it is not school shooting

@Nikluk It is if you are trying to get people to imagine 74 Sandy Hook style massacres - which is what they are trying to do.

@Nikluk They don't want people 2 know that what they are really counting is gang related homicides. That is a lie by omission &amp; manipulation

@Nikluk It is only a different interpretation in you are not trying to get people to picture nine toddlers a day finding a gun.

@Nikluk Yes - most of them suicides and much of the rest are gang related. The measures MDA pushes won't really help: http://t.co/ubKibV7695

@Nikluk And saying target allowed the parking lot demonstration when even mother jones reported it was not on target controlled property.

@Nikluk The lies are: http://t.co/GQlKBSDdvW for example.

@Nikluk That is the misleading data I was referring to. They don't want the public to realize most of those are gang related homicides.

@Nikluk ... compelled to at least post counter evidence when I can to make sure the public is better informed.

@Nikluk But they have a much larger, and more dangerous, goal. And they use lies and misleading data to try to sway the public. So I feel...

@Nikluk Listen - I think these open carry groups are very misguided. If that was the only issue MDA was working on - I wouldn't really mind.

@BluedotGa I challenge you to find an organization with better Standards of Credibility on either side of this issue - from Brady to NRA.

@BluedotGa ... that would support their position. And every statistic is footnoted to the source study.

@BluedotGa That particular site is very good about verifying data and is quick to reject studies with methodological issues - even ones ...

@Nikluk That site tries to collect as many as they can - but just like proving a negative - no one is really counting crime prevented.

@Nikluk Sure. But remember - lives saved without a shot being fired (most defensive gun uses) rarely make the news.

@Nikluk Thank you. That is actually the first time I have shared that in a tweet (I have shared via DM).

@Nikluk @BluedotGa  BTW - to both of you ... I very much appreciate the polite and reasoned discussion. #thankyou  #peace

@Nikluk So that makes it not count? Here you can find thousands of them:

@Nikluk ... but until then - they are just using the word 'children' to paint a different picture than the facts. #akalying

@Nikluk Hey, if they want to try to exclude gang related intentional homicide from those numbers, I am happy to consider them ...

@Nikluk So was the Zimmerman/Martin shooting ... which you brought up. ?????

@BluedotGa Even the most conservative estimates are 500k defensive gun uses per year.

@Nikluk I am not saying they never harm - just that they protect more often than they harm.

@Rain95Mizz @Nikluk The only purpose is to kill - but the police are still able to use them to protect ... aren't they? So are citizens.

@Rain95Mizz @Nikluk And yet it is still used more protectively than destructively. Even the lowest estimates by the CDC are 500k / year.

@Nikluk Or these women who stopped themselves from being raped (one of them for the 2nd time)  http://t.co/9yXMhiaEGt http://t.co/KOhsLxLgHn

@Nikluk No, he made the news. I mean like this woman: http://t.co/MfkOicjxdy who saved her daughter from a kidnapper.

@Nikluk ... 8 young children playing with guns when reality is the vast majority of those are gang related shootings by 18 and 19 YO's.

@Nikluk Yes. I have 3 children - one died as a child (medical) and the oldest is 18. The reason the age is important is MDA want's you ...

@Nikluk Guns are used protectively 1000s times daily. Do those lives not matter just 'cause they are harder 2 count and don't make the news?

@Nikluk Even left-leaning politifact calls that out as a lie - 18 and 19 years old are not children. http://t.co/r2cCJ3AEBl

@nopartyforme @Apev990 @upayr The point, which you will probably never acknowledge, is that guns are used protectively every day.

@ATeichner @MomsDemand But the other facts are correct. They did not go into the store and it was not on Target controlled property.

@PaladinCornelia @marspato This is just bullying by @momsdemand to make a point at this stage of the game. No rear effect.

@PaladinCornelia @marspato ... Target to do about it? It was a legal rally, with police presence, off Target property.

@PaladinCornelia @marspato I can't disagree with you there. But you miss the point. They were not on Target property - what do you want ...

@PaladinCornelia @marspato ... the rally was in a parking lot in front of @target - but not on target property http://t.co/6gvvZEo6ZF

@RonaldAuther @BrindaStar @Target @MomsDemand Especially when OCT has said weeks ago they will no longer open carry guns in stores?

@RonaldAuther @BrindaStar @MomsDemand Even ur if right, what good is @target setting a store policy when rally was not on target property?

@ActUpSpeakOut @Salem4Obama @drhug @OpenCarryTexas I can't even tell where in the parking lot they were - Target may not even control ...

@ActUpSpeakOut @Salem4Obama @drhug @OpenCarryTexas Yes - but they were not in the store. Read my other tweets before replying please. :)

@Aefauld ... does not even have control of the lot. Large signs indicating a rally. But go ahead and milk it for all it is worth to you.

@Aefauld Well, your story came out - no one carrying in the store - looks like probably at the edge of a parking lot - Target probably ...

@Salem4Obama @drhug Not that I think this is a winning tactic either - but I seriously doubt anybody would have had to walk near them 2 shop

@Salem4Obama @drhug  On closer look, it is really hard to tell where they are - the end of the parking lot? Target may not even have control

@Salem4Obama @drhug @momsdemand @shannonrwatts ... except to confuse people and inflame the issue. Again - OCT is *not* carry into stores.

@Salem4Obama @drhug But it does make me wonder why @momsdemand &amp; @shannonrwatts are still tweeting inside pics ... http://t.co/CmTqO704Zq

@Salem4Obama @drhug But I can see how it would scare all the sheeple. I will give you credit for being half right and I will go about my way

@Salem4Obama @drhug I can only shake my head at head at this. It *is* in the parking lot and with clear signage - so I would not be afraid.

@piersmorgan @nycjim Being under attack and having the govt restrict your ability to defend yourself and family? No - I can't.

@SmartAmerica In this case, it doesn't matter that it is peer reviewed as it doesn't answer any meaningful questions.

@SmartAmerica It is clear that you are intelligent, so why you point to a meaningless study like this baffles me.

@davidfrum @SmartAmerica And just like many #guncontrol studies - even if the data ti 100% accurate - it answers a meaningless question.

@SmartAmerica ... to compare to violence before the 1997 #guncontrol law. So it is not nearly as relevant to the question at hand.

@SmartAmerica The data in your study seems to match the chart I sent pretty well - it just doesn't go back as far so you have no basis ...

@SmartAmerica ... would ever get at the VPC (or the NRA for that matter).

@SmartAmerica ... warts and all and give preference to data that are contrary to their viewpoint - which is a hell of a lot more than you ..

@SmartAmerica You seem to be confusing studies and facts. Facts can exist outside of a peer reviewed research project. FBI crime data ...

@SmartAmerica That is certainly reassuring! And you say I am the one who wont believe facts.

@SmartAmerica So then the UK murder rate has fallen to levels that are ... wait ... still higher than B4 #guncontrol http://t.co/H7khXSVJEI

@SmartAmerica Are you saying the article authors made up the numbers or you don't believe the timing?

@SmartAmerica Yeah, well since Heller it has plummeted compared to US overall AND US big city rates: http://t.co/MHDrCH8W3D #freefall

@SmartAmerica ... so even IF gun-crime drops - overall crime rises as criminals shift tactics - VPC studies only report drop in gun crime.

@SmartAmerica ... ignore the crime rise and overall murder rate rise when citizens cannot defend themselves. Criminals will find a way ...

@SmartAmerica Crime and murder rates are NOT irrelevant when talking about the effects of #guncontrol - another favorite VPC trick ...

@SmartAmerica Which is why murder rats in DC plummeted after Heller but skyrocketed in the UK. Other areas with similar results abound.

@SmartAmerica The same thing applies here. What is important is what happens in a given area after a change in #guncontrol.

@SmartAmerica Their violent crime rates have skyrocketed while the US rates have fallen - all while gun rights in the US have expanded.

@SmartAmerica You realize that @piersmorgan's #guncontrol mecca is now the most violent country in Europe, right? http://t.co/UV92InHFJj

@SmartAmerica Seriously? You will believe anything, won't you.

@SmartAmerica ... have problems now???

@SmartAmerica .. to impact criminal availability. At the same time, violent crime rates would rise, as they have in other countries ...

@SmartAmerica My supposition is that you would have to reduce the number of guns in the US to lets say 20% of current levels to even begin..

@SmartAmerica .. to levels that would impact gun-violence rates - and if we somehow could - would there be a shift in non-gun violence rates

@SmartAmerica 2. Gang activities levels, what ever they are, the larger question is what would it take to reduce criminal gun availability..

@SmartAmerica 1. I already admitted, because you use the VPC favored tactic of lumping, that your original premise is technically correct.

@SmartAmerica But the funny thing is that we spiraled down this road - which is largely irrelevant for multiple reasons.

@SmartAmerica Well that works both ways now, doesn't it.

@SmartAmerica And by the way .................. sigh ............. #rollingmyeyes

@SmartAmerica ... do not report it uniformly.  And then there is your backwards percent .. I'm afraid you will have to map that 1 out for me

@SmartAmerica Yeah - those are some pretty tenuous numbers. The report does not break down homicides by type (so you must be compositing)

@themattmager Yeah. Part of me hates the thought of 'stifling' research as much as you. But when you look at the biased drivel that gets ...

@MaritsaTzimas History if full of the strong murdering and pillaging the weak long before guns were invented.

@SmartAmerica I'm not the one that is extrapolating. You seem to be. Where are u coming up with the 1100 gang-related gun murders in the US?

@SmartAmerica That's 36% in the studied cities.

@SmartAmerica It's simple math.  The CDC report you cited studied 5 cities. It listed 2259 gun homicides of which 817 were gang related.

@SmartAmerica Please ...

@SmartAmerica NO ... Killings is a super-set of accidents and murders that also includes suicides.

@SmartAmerica Where did you get the 1100 number from?

@SmartAmerica No, I'm pretty sure the record shows your intentionally vague gun "killings" tweet started the whole thread.

@SmartAmerica Notice how I had the intellectual honest required to admit my error (on the 80%) - still waiting for your admission on the 15%

@SmartAmerica Sure. Ok. Pretty typical of the left to use the most vague term possible in an effort to confuse &amp; conflate. #congratulations

@SmartAmerica I was referencing the percentage of "gun murders" that are attributed to "gang violence".

@Paula68154 I also think that, for safety issues, education is far more effective than legislation - so your safety classes are ok by me. :)

@Paula68154 ... health if we truly want to make a dent in this issue - and give citizens the right to self defense in places of work, etc.

@Paula68154 ... when you think it through, you realize that really would not any significant impact. I think we have to focus on mental ...

@Paula68154 Honestly, a part of me could support background check fixes as long as they don't extend to private party sales ... But ...

@themattmager As a starting point, I use the 1994 CDC study (under Clinton no less) showing 500k defensive gun uses per year.

@themattmager Right, because if we don't trust the NRA numbers, by all means - lets listen to the unbiased VPC!!

@SmartAmerica I haven't seen you even try to back up that assertions with any "facts" ...

@SmartAmerica But lets not lose sight of what started this discussion ... your wild claim that "most gun killings committed by legal owners"

@SmartAmerica ... of those, 817 were identified as gang related ... that is 36%. So, it seems we both were off base quite a bit.

@SmartAmerica But I think you may lack some basic math skills.  Looking at just the firearm homicides for the 5 cities studied: total 2259

@SmartAmerica ... estimates from Chicago and other places: http://t.co/dwUFANfwGC

@SmartAmerica ... it looks like they were applying the 80% to CDC firearm homicide numbers. I think the 80% probably started with police ...

@SmartAmerica I will have to retract - somewhat. The 80% figure was linked to the CDC at several places, but upon closer examination ...

@SmartAmerica I am pretty serious. I don't tend to pull facts out of thin air.

@Margie_90 @RoadGunner I always appreciate civil discourse ... goodnight.

@Margie_90 I would just encourage you to research a little. The topic is far more complex than I think you give it credit for.

@Margie_90 A 1994 CDC study (under Clinton BTW) found at least 500k defensive gun uses per year in the US.

@Margie_90 It is true, that a gun is a very effective tool for killing - and yet it is used many times more often to save lives.

@SmartAmerica You said 'gun killings'. More than half of all gun deaths are suicides with gang violence being about 80-85% of gun murders.

@Margie_90 But you do not have to have a drivers licence to own a car - you only need it to drive on public streets.

@Margie_90 In the vast majority of states, you have to take a written and practical test to get a concealed carry license.

@Margie_90 And then they would take other forms, like Bath school disaster in 1927 - still the deadliest school killing in the US - no guns

@Margie_90 The gun massacres will not stop unless you were to achieve a total ban and probably a 90% reduction of guns in the US.

@Margie_90 You are diverting the subject. Automatic weapons are very tightly controlled and have been for a very long time.

@Margie_90 BTW, I really appreciate the civil discussion. :) I know this is a contentious issue and courtesy matters.

@Margie_90 You can't walk into walmart and buy an automatic weapon. They have been strictly controlled since 1934.

@Margie_90 ... a background check, will still get a gun.

@Margie_90 You didn't come out and say it - but your premise requires a near total ban. Otherwise, Lanza, Homes, and Alexis (who passed ...

@Margie_90 True. No doubt. So your plan is to ban and confiscate ALL guns in the US?

@Margie_90 They do kill sometimes, but we know, by using critical thinking skills and data, that they save more lives - just like guns in US

@Margie_90 Really? Do you know how many people, especially children are killed by airbags each year?

@Margie_90 ... use critical thinking skills. I am 100% sure many of people present in New LIfe church that morning would count themselves.

@Margie_90 That's the difficulty in counting how many of a thing are prevented. It doesn't mean they don't occur, but you have to use ...

@Margie_90 And how many people can you say with certainty have been saved by airbags in cars? Does that mean they don't save lives? Prove it

@Margie_90 Then there is this excellent compilation of spree killings: http://t.co/JAjmZ5ei5q http://t.co/4Ie5w3PRkk

@Margie_90 ... negative - but here are 9 incidents that most likely would have become mass shootings: http://t.co/Cp3pjd3DkW

@Margie_90 What "facts" are those? That no mass shootings have been stopped by armed civilians? Well, of course it is hard to prove a ...

@SJACK_68 I think the 1st was written at about the same time, when communicating widely often required a person to yell in the streets.

@Margie_90 Wow! What a complete absurd article answering mostly intentionally pretend arguments with bogus data! Wow!

@SmartAmerica And where did you did that false fact from seeings how most gun killings occur between rival gang members.

@MaritsaTzimas Agreed! Nor do they have the right to take anyone's ability to defend their own lives or the lives of their family.

@Paula68154 This shooter passed the background when he purchased the shotgun. #howwouldthathavehelped

@themattmager And I am compelled by the lack of body counts - the countless thousands of lives saved every day by defensive use of firearms.

@tutticontenti And the #guncontrol magic pill that would have stopped this shooting is?

@markfollman @JohnRLottJr @piersmorgan What an absurd article. Pretends to present the pro-gun arguments so that it can tear them down.

@piersmorgan @Kamikaze_98 The rebuttals in that article are so absurd, i wouldn't even know where to begin. #drivel

@piersmorgan And it matters that you don't a shred of #journalisticintegrity or you would retract your insane angry rant at @benfergusonshow

@piersmorgan It matters that you constantly preach that banning a certain weapon will stop spree killings despite all facts and logic. Boom!

RT @Muffet123: we have another opportunity to "dialog" about our mental health care system &amp; instead we'll focus on #Guncontrol.

Confirmed! @piersmorgan was wrong yet again - gunman did not bring AR15 - will he retract his angered assertions to @benfergusonshow? #phht

@lindabella81 Did you actually go and read how that data was compiled? It is pretty compelling: http://t.co/JAjmZ5ei5q

@lindabella81 Lol. Or, how about we simply allow people the right to defend themselves if they so choose? The data clearly shows it works.

@MrMilitantNegro @SEveningstar But you see, Pizza Hut and Dominoes will be forced to do the same. So you will end up with cardboard anyway.

@debralynnlazar Yes, I agree - and really do appreciate it. :)  #goodnight

@debralynnlazar What other tool can be so effective, besides a gun, to provide her with a useful defense? @debralynnlazar

@debralynnlazar Can I try one more time?

@debralynnlazar No it's not rocket science. And I really do appreciate the civil discourse - as always.

@debralynnlazar Yes they do! But if guns make it 50 times easier to kill, then they also make it 500 times easier to defend!

@debralynnlazar Sure. Women have been abused and killed for centuries before gunpowder was ever discovered. #gunnotrequired

@debralynnlazar The firearm is the first weapon requiring so little training and strength to effectively neutralize that disparity.

@debralynnlazar The entire history of mankind is filled with incidents of the strong victimizing the weak using whatever means are at hand.

@debralynnlazar Arguable. I can find dozens of stories of people who used guns to defend against stronger thugs using knives or fist.

@debralynnlazar No data on gun use is ever unbiased (none! not Lott not Kellerman). That is why one has to look at the compilation methods.

@nhdogmom @KellyAyotte @parislady1492 Ok. But that is off topic. Do you still deny that the buzz about banning certain guns drive sales?

@debralynnlazar Agreed! But guns are used protectively far more often than destructively in the US.

@debralynnlazar Again, I ask you to read the methods used to compile the data in that infographic and then tell me it was biased - or wrong.

@debralynnlazar ... but the data is very clear that guns in the right hands save lives - on a daily basis.

@nhdogmom @KellyAyotte @parislady1492 I really appreciate the civil discourse. I hope u don't mind if I try a little harder 2 clear this up.

I wonder if @piersmorgan will have the #journalisticintegrity to retract if confirmed shooter started only with shotgun. NM, I don't wonder.

Watching @piersmorgan try to use statistics is like watching a toddler try to fly a plane - too much to grasp and will quickly crash &amp; burn.

@nirmski @LouiseMensch @piersmorgan Maybe ... it depends entirely on the distance between GZ and TM and who closed that distance.

@mrjoelclark @LouiseMensch @piersmorgan Dark night, TM wearing hoodie cutting between houses. Did GZ know TM's race when he first spotted?

@ChloMasson GZ's attorney said  "There are no winners. There are no monsters". I think that is correct here for both GZ and TM.

@ChloMasson It is too bad for both of them and to bad for the US and how much it is revealing division in the US.

@ChloMasson BTW, I really appreciate the civil discussion.  ;) Thank you.

@ChloMasson No! Police kill innocent folks 11 times more often than citizens. But they have a different role so its not fair to compare.

@piersmorgan Yes! GZ would have called &amp; followed MarkZ wearing a hoodie also. I don't think he even KNEW TM's race at first - it was dark!

@ChloMasson But in spite of that training, they are human and make mistakes and innocent people are killed.

RT @dawnkclark: @Imkevinfarley Seek justice for the forty five Trayvon Martins that die in Chicago every month. http://t.co/TJPG6Kovxd

@ChloMasson So by that logic, any time a police officer is forced to shoot and kill someone, they should also be sentenced. Correct?

@ChloMasson Why? I can't wrap my head around that. He should have let himself get beaten to death?

@ChloMasson @MaudBetard ... this does not tell the world it is OK to kill an unarmed boy in the US - not even remotely.

@hushkatelyn I have heard the phone call - he stopped following. If his last name was Sanchez instead of Zimmerman you wouldn't even care.

@RBPundit It depends ... is your last name english or hispanic in origin? I think if GZ's dad had been hispanic, there would be crickets.

@hushkatelyn He was being followed at a distance, not pursued - and he stopped when told to stop. That does not warrant being attacked.

@GOPUSA_MN @CoreCamper @iamdannistarr Exactly! Bottom line is you have to have evidence not just emotion before you convict.

@hushkatelyn He did obey the dispatcher. He was following to see where he was going and turned around when told to.

@ChloMasson @MaudBetard Ok. But if GZ's dad was hispanic instead of his mom, we would have never even heard about this story.

@piersmorgan And yet, you always say you support US right to guns. GZ's gun has a 7 round magazine. I guess you would want to limit it to 6?

@dccollegedems True! But that statement has little to do with this case as they should not be allowed to attack someone. #twistedfacts

@PattyMayonaze @LifeofJuanTwo The article acknowledges its own holes, but then goes on using them as a foundation. But good arguments ...

@LifeofJuanTwo @PattyMayonaze Thank you Juan!

@LifeofJuanTwo @PattyMayonaze But just because they are harder to count, it doesn't make them any less real. Real lives of real people.

@LifeofJuanTwo @PattyMayonaze The thing is, it is much harder to count the lives protected by guns because they don't become a statistic.

@clgoddard @nra They didn't take it down, the entire site is satire ... like theonion.

Another 1 bites the dust. @kerriejaques accuses me of celebrating death &amp; shunning facts yet blocks my account when presented with the facts

@kerriejaques ...and I don't celebrate a single gun death. I'm just not willing to ignore lives saved by guns. I like to look at both sides.

@kerriejaques Ok, sorry for trying to have a reasoned discussion with you. The facts are out there ...

@kerriejaques http://t.co/pOLmJO3PTZ is a really good site. Unlike 'facts' from right and left sources - they actually have standards.

@kerriejaques Defensive guns uses occur at least 500k times per year, some estimates are much higher: http://t.co/35hOqLkKwv

@kerriejaques Worst school massacre in history was explosives in 1927. http://t.co/iJyDqE8993

@kerriejaques What are the dynamics of gang culture in the inter-cities (which account for upwards of 70% of all gun homicides?)

@kerriejaques Again, you cannot compare countries outright. What is population density of big cities in Canada or England compared to US?

@kerriejaques They also don't mention that more than half of all gun deaths are suicides and the vast majority of the rest are gang related.

@kerriejaques See, the anti-gun groups only give 'gun death' numbers as if it is somehow better to be killed with a knife or a bat.

@kerriejaques In Washington DC, overall murder rate has fallen since the Heller decision in 2008: http://t.co/3FxS9QcIdx

@kerriejaques See: http://t.co/UV92InHFJj I don't have overall murder and violent crime data for Japan.

@kerriejaques In UK, the overall murder rate continued the slight decline that had began before while overall violent crime has skyrocketed.

@kerriejaques ... can be very revealing.

@kerriejaques But what you can do is look at what happens to violent crime in a given area after a change in gun-control laws. The delta ...

@kerriejaques ... socio-economic dynamics, gangs, drugs, population density in cities, access to mental health care, etc.

@kerriejaques First, you have to understand that you cannot compare countries outright. Too many unaccountable variables. Such as ...

@kerriejaques I can't argue that most gun crimes and deaths are preventable. It just can't be achieved via gun-control legislation.

@kerriejaques No, calling me a gun nut is inflammatory.

Do you seriously not know this was satire? MT @clgoddard: @NRA Prez Jim Porter: "We Can Own Colored People Again” http://t.co/gQXaw2cV3b

@kerriejaques If you do not wish to continue, I will understand. But know that I am not the one using inflammatory language.  #peace

@kerriejaques I don't want to 'have this one'. I am only trying to show you that the issue if far more complex than it may seem.

@kerriejaques I am not trying to be brash. Sorry if it seems that way. You said 'negates every one!'. I am trying to expand your thinking.

@kerriejaques There are, of course, many many more. The point is that their stories, while much harder to count, are no less real.

@kerriejaques This women should have let herself get raped for the second time by the same man? http://t.co/BU4zLxU1tC #marginallygoodreason

@kerriejaques Does it negate this one? This Mom should have just let her two year old get kidnapped? http://t.co/BU4zLxU1tC

@kerriejaques Just because it is harder to count the number of people saved by defensive gun use doesn't make them any less real.

@kerriejaques But more than that, Guns are protectively far far more often than destructively in the US.

@PhilSykes3 ... continually de-legitimize and demonize gun owners. BTW, I really appreciate the calm, rational discussion.

@PhilSykes3 'Change the culture' has some validity. Education would be the key, IMO. But that won't happen as long as the left tries to ...

@PhilSykes3 Just like teaching babies to survival swim doesn't mean you don't fence the pool. But it may save a life when one slips through.

@PhilSykes3 My argument would be to educate the child about gun use AND educate the parent about securing them when not supervised.

@piersmorgan @NRA Right! Because a person who shoots at cops is going to obey the law to not own an AK-47. Ok, I got it. #rollingmyeyes

@PhilSykes3 Education is almost always more effective than legislation.

@PhilSykes3 Is it? Watch this video and see if you think there could be any correlation to kids and guns: http://t.co/OG9xijswXb

@PhilSykes3 I understand that feeling. But why pick something that will not really help the problem and may, in fact, cost more lives?

@junkobot @roobarb11 ... My experiment with the Wikipedia chart proves how meaningless it is. No correlation to right to bear arms &amp; murder.

@junkobot @roobarb11 Yes. But comparing countries directly is fraught with uncontrolled variables rendering it useless ...

@roobarb11 I don't even own an AR-15 - but the data is clear that banning them will stop any of this: http://t.co/pkuQijbz

@roobarb11 I am not opposed to all measures either. I get frustrated when the focus is on types of hardware rather than prevention.

@roobarb11 @junkobot I don't fear having a flat tire, but I carry a spare tire anyway. Being prepared for something is not the same as fear.

@roobarb11 (2/2) gun owner is less than being hit by lighting. So I think the perception of the risks of these two things are out of whack.

@roobarb11 (1/2) Perhaps this will help. Risk of being a victim of violent crime in US is nearly 1 in 2. Risk of being shot by licensed ...

@roobarb11 @junkobot That's very interesting. That could also explain the initial rise in murders followed by a drop.

@roobarb11 @junkobot And that still won't take all factors into account - but better than trying to compare countries outright.

@roobarb11 @junkobot Correct. Very complex. That's why I try to focus more on what happens in a given region after a change in #guncontrol.

@roobarb11 @junkobot It looks like it extended well into the 2000's http://t.co/l5UxsaSm

@roobarb11 @junkobot I used to not give it any thought either, and I used to share more of your views.

@roobarb11 @junkobot My main point is that it is a much more complex issue than many think. Much more complex.

@roobarb11 @junkobot Why did murder rates in Washington D.C. plummet after 2008 Heller decision restoring gun rights? http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@roobarb11 @junkobot I understand that. But did it rise after #guncontrol? Why did violent crime and murder in UK rise after #guncontrol?

@roobarb11 @junkobot But even if it did stop mass murders,- if result is more violent crime and no change to murder rates, was it net good?

@roobarb11 @junkobot Perhaps. But you have had a school shooting (Monash) since then and AU didn't have that many mass murders before.

@junkobot @roobarb11 BTW, I wanted to say thank you for the civil discussion to both of you. I know this is a contentious issue.

@junkobot @roobarb11 Japan has had strict gun laws for a long time, so I don't have any data on the impact on crime.

@junkobot I understand - I also have no illusions about changing minds. I just hope to show the issue is more complex than people understand

@roobarb11 @junkobot And guns protects the weak from the powerful everyday - the powerful do not have to have gun to cause harm to the weak.

@roobarb11 @junkobot If am not armed somewhere, either by choice or law, I only feel unprepared - I do not feel scared.

@roobarb11 @junkobot I don't live in fear - even when not armed.

@roobarb11 @junkobot And there is some evidence murder rates were already falling: http://t.co/VakuBV9p So one might still question net good

@roobarb11 @junkobot AU seems to be only country I have found where murder rates did fall after #guncontrol. But violent crime rates are up.

Good piece? This is an outstanding article!! MT @piersmorgan: Good piece @jonsnowC4 @cathynewman http://t.co/ua3mgmsM #guncontrol #balanced

@FickleFanofBWFC But, handguns are also the most used tool for selfdefense. If you were to ban all guns, murder and violent crime would rise

Now you now I read that in my best Admiral Ackbar: RT @ToddKincannon: Don't engage him. It's a trap!

@piersmorgan Fort Hood soldiers are not allowed to be armed. Do you have to lie to make your point? That medical center WAS a gun free zone.

@piersmorgan They go to gun free zones precisely because they plan to die by their own hands &amp; they want to kill as many as they can before.

@piersmorgan If nearby states are the reason Chicago gets guns, how would a federal ban keep AW's from pouring though border with Mex?

Why can't @piersmorgan acknowledge that CT and Aurora shooters had other weapons with them? #journalisticintegrity

@piersmorgan Oregon shopping mall BTW is not a mass-shooting by FBI definition. And it doesn't qualify because an armed citizen intervened.

@debralynnlazar I guess I would have to say lucky for the nation as well as our murder and crime rates would most likely crime.

@debralynnlazar So that would be all guns, essentially, except I guess perhaps revolvers?

@debralynnlazar That is very tragic and it makes me furious that we are wasting our efforts on useless measures.

@debralynnlazar Why do assault weapons (semi-automatic rifle) = mass murder anymore than handgun (semi-automatic pistol) = mass murder?

@debralynnlazar People feel compelled to make changes based upon emotion. It does not mean those changes will achieve the desired result.

@piersmorgan They are not effectively machine guns. Repeating a falsehood frequently does not make it any more true. #wakeup

@debralynnlazar Don't forget CT and Aurora shooters had handguns, VT and Columbine only had handguns ... an AWB ban will not prevent these.

@piersmorgan Let your guest talk!!!!!!

@piersmorgan Because cars do not frequently protect the weak from the hands of the strong like guns are 500,000 per year. #guncontrol

@ImperfectANG3L @USABob If a near total ban causes murder and violent crime rates to rise, don't you think a total ban will raise them more?

@debralynnlazar That is truely sad. Slightly less sad are those who think banning a certain type of weapon will prevent the next one.

Will @piersmorgan actually hear Dr. Fox? "If you expect that this will prevent the next Sandy Hook, you will be bitterly disappointed." #duh

@ImperfectANG3L Like UK and AU did where violent crime has increased? http://t.co/VakuBV9p #guncontrol

RT @exodus_2011: LOL - U guys have got to see this 10  min video by James O'Keefe, visiting Journalists who advocate for #GunControl

@ImperfectANG3L How will banning guns stop violence in US when it has proven to increase violence everywhere it has been tried? #guncontrol

@sdsorrentino It's signed ... let's see if your right. http://t.co/Qh9ZVmGm

Your ban of so called 'assault weapons' would have stopped this how? MT @piersmorgan: BREAKING: Another day, another school shooting

@duplissea But they work to give "preferentiality to figures that are contrary to our viewpoints" - They show 'warts' and all.

@duplissea If you like facts, here is a really good site: http://t.co/o5QGOGJ5 Of course no site if unbiased - on either side.

@BNPARENAZISCUM @TheTeaParty_net If he had used a knife, yes. The handguns he had with him? No - no difference. You want total ban all guns?

@duplissea Most every type of gun in US is semi-automatic -including most pistols. Look at freq of murders with rifles: http://t.co/d3P3bULp

@BNPARENAZISCUM @TheTeaParty_net Why does being killed with a gun make you more dead than being killed any other way? #guncontrol

@BNPARENAZISCUM @TheTeaParty_net No to mention overall murder rate and violent crime rates are up in UK after #guncontrol.

@BNPARENAZISCUM @TheTeaParty_net So how would a ban on so called 'assault weapons' have stopped any of them? http://t.co/1iF5lwz3

@BNPARENAZISCUM @TheTeaParty_net Really? You know that CT and Aurora shooters had other guns and that VT and Columbine had only pistols?

Only it wont and it may cost lives. MT @BNPARENAZISCUM: @TheTeaParty_net #guncontrol about saving kids lives

@FickleFanofBWFC So called 'assault weapons' are a subset of the rifles class. So how much would a ban do? http://t.co/UUTGSPMu

@FickleFanofBWFC And there is the rub. Handguns are most popular for defense, but also most used to kill. See chart: http://t.co/RIIDVosa

@FickleFanofBWFC Those who go through the process of getting legal permission to carry in public tend to be extremely law abiding.

@FickleFanofBWFC You mention armed citizens. Chart showing conviction rates of CHL holders vs general pop in Texas: http://t.co/iUsHu3qL

@FickleFanofBWFC @piersmorgan Here is an interesting video pointing out impact of population density. http://t.co/Pq6X9tJ3 #guncontrol

@FickleFanofBWFC You are from the UK, right?

@FickleFanofBWFC ... but give 'preferentiality to figures that are contrary to our viewpoints'

@FickleFanofBWFC Here is a really good site with real gun data ... warts and all: http://t.co/o5QGOGJ5 They lean conservative but ...

@FickleFanofBWFC No - that's not irrational at all. It's irrational to be more afraid in a country with 1/5 violent crime rate than your own

@FickleFanofBWFC Because armed citizens have a deterrent effect - which is also logical. ;)

@FickleFanofBWFC Did you know 1982 study of felons found: 40% decided not to commit a crime because they believed that the victim had a gun?

@FickleFanofBWFC BTW, I appreciate the civil discussion. I know this is a contentious issue.

@FickleFanofBWFC Perhaps. But some will still get them and others will be emboldened to commit crimes without them because victim is unarmed

@FickleFanofBWFC Irrational just like people afraid to fly even though much less risky than driving. U are just less scared of what you know

@sgeoffa Pls RT: Tell @VP Biden's Tasks Force: Listen to voters, not #guncontrol groups! http://t.co/bLAw2f9L #tcot #mentalhealth #nra #2A

@FickleFanofBWFC In US. We were talking about defensive gun uses in US. You said 'but at least it'd be illegal to obtain one'.

@FickleFanofBWFC Safe to walk the streets? Really? http://t.co/9vivukbX UK violent crime rate 5 times worse than US! #guncontrol

@FickleFanofBWFC Did U know that majority of violent crimes are committed by previous felons? It is already illegal for them 2 have gun!

@FickleFanofBWFC Washington DC murder rates fell faster than rest of US after 2008 Heller http://t.co/yzUvrjDx Was that net bad? #guncontrol

@FickleFanofBWFC AU gun ban may have decreased murders (they were already falling) but violent crime rates soared! Was it still net good?

@FickleFanofBWFC UK gun ban did decrease gun-murders - but overall murder and violent crime rates rose. Was it still net good? #guncontrol

@FickleFanofBWFC I can't say. How many of those would have a gun anyway and how many would commit crime even without a gun?

@FickleFanofBWFC How does 'murders not provoked' minimize thousands of lives protected by guns? 500k defensive gun uses/yr (minimum)

@DarthSavage1220 No, because they are not frequently used to protect life like semi-auto are every single day.

@DarthSavage1220 ... its that it wouldn't have helped in most ... perhaps even any of them.

@DarthSavage1220 CT and Aurora had other weapons. VT and Columbine only used handguns. It's not that it wouldn't help in just one ...

@FickleFanofBWFC What is unprovoked? ... And a gun is the best tool for protecting the weak from the powerful - happens everyday.

Because that hasn't been tried. MT @piersmorgan: hunt &amp; jail them &gt; MT @WendyW_A tell that to gangs &amp; criminals who won't be following laws.

@DarthSavage1220 We would lobby for changes that would actually help. CT shooter had two handguns with him so banning rifles = no difference

@FickleFanofBWFC @piersmorgan Just because it is harder to count the (many more) lives protected by guns, it doesn't make them any less real

@FickleFanofBWFC I'm sure these two women protected from rape (one from a second rape) think so: http://t.co/mtDxTI17 http://t.co/hPJogtkd

@FickleFanofBWFC @piersmorgan Is this one good reason? http://t.co/4W2k3Nde I'm sure both the Mom and daughter think so.

@duplissea Just because the lives saved by guns are harder to count, it doesn't make them any less real. #guncontrol

@duplissea This woman: http://t.co/4W2k3Nde and this cop: http://t.co/hwEqdD8g were protected from real beatings ... possibly to death.

@duplissea These women were saved from real rapes (one a second time by the same criminal): http://t.co/hPJogtkd http://t.co/mtDxTI17

@duplissea This Mom really did save her daughter from kidnapping - those are real lives impacted: http://t.co/4W2k3Nde

@duplissea No no. We consider what has happened to hundreds of thousands of people each yr ... lives protected because a gun was available.

@piersmorgan He had TWO handguns with him!! Are you really that dense? The outcome would not have changed!! #whatatool

@piersmorgan And yet the bans won't stop a single one. They will end up costing lives. #sadreally But I support your mental health proposal.

@chrisgaler What good does it do to lower gun-murders if more people end up being murdered - just by other methods and more violent crime?

And a gun will be used for self defense over 1300 times. MT @piersmorgan: tomorrow, around 30 will be murdered by guns, 49 will shoot selves

@chrisgaler What can I do to clear it up?

@chrisgaler ... only served to enable more death and more harm at the hands of crimiinals. #guncontrol

@chrisgaler ... at guns deaths in a vacuum. You might lower gun-deaths but if more people are murdered and raped as a result, you have ...

@chrisgaler I understand that. But disarming citizens has a negative impact on violent crime, including murder. You can't look at only ...

@debralynnlazar Sorry.  :(

@chrisgaler Being killed by a gun does not make one any more dead than being killed any other way. Murder and violent crime rates are key.

@ByVerbalExpress You do realize that pasty skin pre-cogs don't actually exist ... right? #guncontrol

@LorrieLynnLowe Pls RT: Tell @VP Biden's Tasks Force: Listen to voters, not #guncontrol groups! http://t.co/bLAw2f9L #tcot #mentalhealth

@ByVerbalExpress Wait, what? You would use pre-cogs to find people who enjoy hurting/killing others? #guncontrol #minorityreport

@piersmorgan And both Aurora and Sandy Hook killers had other weapons with them. Why can't you understand the significance of that?

@ByVerbalExpress So would you employ pre-cogs for this predictive analysis?  :o)

@gunfreeschools Nobody says guns make one invincible or immune to crime. But not all incidents go down like that one. #guncontrol

@ByVerbalExpress She said hi.  :)

@ByVerbalExpress That plus realizing that criminals don't obey laws and like disarmed victims is a pretty sure sign of the results.

@ByVerbalExpress Agree. And an element that takes pleasure in hurting others (i.e. violent crimes).

@ByVerbalExpress I'll be back ... and will continue if your willing. Must spend time with the wife.

@ByVerbalExpress How about the fact that nearly every country that has implemented strict #guncontrol has seen murder and crime rates rise.

@ByVerbalExpress Please, I await your solutions.

@ByVerbalExpress Fine ... you brought it up.  :) BTW, I will take a break soon for game. But I appreciate the civil discourse.

@ByVerbalExpress Ahhh. No. Some studies show 100,000 lives saved each year. Plus, less crime/murders are even attempted because guns.

@ByVerbalExpress Really, so your solution is to what? Ban so called 'assault weapons'? Yeah, that will help" http://t.co/pkuQijbz

@ByVerbalExpress Please show me this evidence - I have not seen it

@ByVerbalExpress No, I quoted 500,000 defensive uses a year (low estimate from 1994 CDC study under Clinton). Many were lives saved.

@ByVerbalExpress Or we could focus on efforts that would actually help. 1. Mental Heath 2. NCIC links to MH 3. Elimination of gun-free zones

@ByVerbalExpress Even harder to count the lives saved ...

@ByVerbalExpress I have followed the evidence. GZ was getting beaten to death. The only real question is, who confronted who?

@ByVerbalExpress My response to that would be that both rights are 100% true and generally not contradictory. #guncontrol

@ByVerbalExpress Just because the lives protected by guns are harder to count, it doesn't make them any less real. 500,000 defenses per year

@ByVerbalExpress I am sure his mother did. But the discussion started with "Gun owners say they have the right to carry" - thus my response.

@ByVerbalExpress Sure, but what exactly did happen? Do you know? Because I know that I don't know. I wan't justice - true justice to be done

@ByVerbalExpress 3. Did you know a concealed weapon carrier saved lives during Clackamas mall shooting? http://t.co/WReKpfFl #guncontrol

@ByVerbalExpress 2. CT shooter was not a concealed licence carrier

@ByVerbalExpress 3 things. 1. lets let jury decide trayvon/zimmerman case - justice is blind and there are conflicting facts

@ByVerbalExpress They can argue all they want. The facts remain. CHL holders are more law abiding even than cops. http://t.co/CT5NZ6ly

@piersmorgan We have been in Afghanistan for over a decade fighting insurgents. I think the Amer. citizens have a shot. (p2) @benshapiro

@piersmorgan That is so asinine - you are assuming a full on assault rather than an attempt at occupation and control. (p1) @benshapiro

@TRR7476 And just like during prohibition, demand will be filled. Criminals will then be way better armed than cops and civilians alike.

@TRR7476 Of course. I just wanted to cover that one aspect. Mexico is flush with real military assault weapons from S. America.

@troublebunnie Glad you are feeling better.

@chrisgaler @_craigdobson Gun-deaths are not total impact of #guncontrol - that is a distraction from overall murder rates and violent crime

@chrisgaler @_craigdobson While murder rate in D.C. fell much faster than US after 2008 Heller decision: http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@chrisgaler @_craigdobson UK murder &amp; violent crime rates rose after #guncontrol. UK is now most violent nation in EU: http://t.co/9vivukbX

@chrisgaler @_craigdobson What is important is to see what happens to a given region after a change to #guncontrol -then you can see impact.

@chrisgaler @_craigdobson There are simply too many variables; socio-economic, crime, gangs, drugs, access to mental HC, population density.

@chrisgaler @_craigdobson I don't know ... and nobody really does. Certainly guns are a factor, but you can't compare countries outright...

@_craigdobson And like Washington D.C. which saw a dramatic drop in murder rate after 2008 Heller decision: http://t.co/yzUvrjDx #guncontrol

@_craigdobson But watching what happens after a change in #guncontrol can tell you something about the impact of that change. Like UK and AU

@_craigdobson ... drugs, access to mental health care, population density, etc. There are too many variables for it to have any meaning.

@_craigdobson Comparing countries outright if meaningless as you can't control for the many variables; socio-economic, crime, gangs ...

@the1theycallMr @allforjury ... because they are almost never used in crimes: http://t.co/pkuQijbz So banning them will not change anything.

@the1theycallMr @allforjury I understand that argument, and while I might disagree, the main point is that it is still the wrong focus ...

@DimitriQvintus Sure. I can't say that I disagree with that. The pre-existing freedom enumerated in the 2nd is sometimes used to cause harm.

@piersmorgan Nobody cares that you lobby for your viewpoint. We care that you do it in an #intellectuallydishonest manner. #guncontrol

@benshapiro nailed it when he pointed out @piersmorgan bullying tactics. He refuses to have an actual conversation. #guncontrol

@piersmorgan Please invite @benshapiro back on your show. That was the best interview on the topic yet! #guncontrol

@ShitGunNutsSay ... the semi-automatic kind called 'assault weapons' here. Do you remember prohibition? The gap will be filled - with what?

@ShitGunNutsSay And you know we have an extremely porous border with Mexico who is flush with true with real assault rifles - not just ...

@ShitGunNutsSay I think many of the proposals now would only make the situation worse. You have seen this chart, right? http://t.co/pkuQijbz

@DimitriQvintus ... weapons. So just like prohibition, you risk making the situation worse. All laws have unintended consequences. #careful

@DimitriQvintus ... contend with our extremely porous border of Mexico which is flush with guns, including many true military assault ...

@DimitriQvintus ... in the US. So take those away and you have 296M guns still. Do you think that will stem availability? Then you have ...

@DimitriQvintus ... you are not going to lower the quantities enough to make a dent in those figures. Estimates about 4M "assault rifles" ..

@DimitriQvintus Even if that connection were true, how would you go about changing it? Unless you implement massive restrictions ...

@DimitriQvintus Yet you think odds are high of being shot because of guns but odds are really low. So who lives in fear?

@DimitriQvintus I don't think it is a technicality. You think I carry a gun because I live in fear - I do not. I am simply prepared.

@the1theycallMr @allforjury That's why we use crime rates and not total numbers like @piersmorgan - because wetry to avoid distortion.

@the1theycallMr @allforjury Chris. Rate means number of crimes per some number of population (usually 100,000) so it is adjusted for popu.

@allforjury Sure - that makes sense. That would be one of the largest factors.

@Aztec2012 @allforjury @the1theycallMr No doubt that education has an impact on crime rates.

@allforjury @the1theycallMr Can't argue with that.

@saysshe2011 @doctorjoe56 I agree with this. There are some holes that we can close.

@xeni Ok, sorry. It was your article and I so I started by asking you. :) My apologies.

@doctorjoe56 @saysshe2011 I agree! So lets pursue something that would work, like addressing mental health, instead of failed #guncontrol.

Why can't @piersmorgan give the same calm patience to Lott, Pratt &amp; others that he offered Alex Jones? He can't deal with truth. #guncontrol

@piersmorgan Why don't u bring Lott back on with the same forum as Jones but this time let him speak? Could it be that the facts scare you?

@piersmorgan showed unbelievable patience with screaming Alex Jones. So why does he cut off Lott, Pratt &amp; other cooler heads? #guncontrol

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones It only compounds the problem of violence and cost a lot more money in the end.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones Believe me, my leanings r libertarian. But we cannot allow justice and prison systems to deal with mentally ill.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones And we need to eliminate the concept of gun free zones which have proven produce higher body counts.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones We need better funding for mental health care. Better linking to NCIC, but care must be used to avoid abuse.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones Outcome would not be very different. And people will still feel the strong need to 'do something'.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones The evidence says otherwise. I can't find a mass shooting where they only had access to a semi-auto rifle.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones I know, and that is sad. But why focus on what will make the least amount of difference?

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones Instead of focusing on hardware, why not target the actual issues and look for something that will help?

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones If if you get your ban and the next killer uses handgun &amp; 10 rnd mags to kill 35 kids in a jr high, what next?

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones All rifles, of which so called 'assualt weapons' are a subset, r 4% of all gun murders: http://t.co/pkuQijbz

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones VT and Columbine used only handguns. It won't stop a single mass shooter.

@JaredJBaker @RealAlexJones One thing that is wrong with it is that it won't make a difference. CT and Aurora shooters had handguns.

RT @DVCMAC: Canada tried strict #guncontrol in 1995. Here are the results so far: It is ineffective &amp; counter-productive. http://t.c ...

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris 3. Because citizens can no longer defend themselves, violent crime skyrockets - just about every-time.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris 2. Many who don't get a gun will still find a way to kill. This is why UK murder rate rose after ban

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris 1. Despite the strongest bans, some criminals will still get guns. This is proven in UK, AU and other places

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris You are just stuck on gun-deaths only which ignores three common sense truths:

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris What are you talking about? I have given you the facts, you just don't like them.

@MaureenPanzera @Mozi_N But they don't! They create less gun-deaths ... but not less over all deaths and not less violent crime.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris While in D.C., murder rate has fallen much faster than US after 2008 Heller: http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris In AU, murder is down - but violent crime has skyrocketed -rapes are higher than ever.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris In UK, murder and violent crime are way up. http://t.co/9vivukbX http://t.co/ZKYBG5CW

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris Only then can you begin to discover the impact of #guncontrol.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris What is important is to watch how murder &amp; crime rates change in a region after a change to #guncontrol.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris All have different culture, socio-economic conditions, crime, gangs, access to mental health care.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris Not a theory breaker at all. You can't compare countries outright. Too many variables to account for.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris I'm sorry. I didn't realize that firearm deaths make you more dead than other types of murder.

@reaper11b81 No doubt. But like Don Quixote I feel compelled to continue jousting away trying to slay ignorance.

@reaper11b81 Good point, but we are not going to legislate that away ... and that is not what she was referring to.

@MaureenPanzera @hardball_chris If #guncontrol did work, UK and AU would have the lowest violent crime rates ... but they don't!

@YvetteClarke There are no automatic weapons on our streets. #guncontrol

@ShitGunNutsSay But the biggest gripe I have is that by focusing on hardware, we are missing the real issue and NOTHING would change.

@ShitGunNutsSay .223 is a small round that is actually called a varmint round because it is not useful for larger game.

@ShitGunNutsSay I do have mixed feelings about this. But, first of all, they are not assault weapons. They are not-fully automatic.

@ShitGunNutsSay He had 10 and 15 round mags. I erroneously though he only had 2 15 rnd mags and the rest were 10 rnd mags.

@troublebunnie I would be ok with that being a part of it. Education is a much better solution than legislation - for just about anything.

@ShitGunNutsSay It will just make people feel better until the next mass-killing occurs using a handgun with 10 round magazines (like VT).

@JoeBobsThoughts While murder and violent crime rates in the UK have spiked after gun control laws. How do you explain that?

@JoeBobsThoughts And yet as more guns sold and more right to carry laws, both murder and violent crime rates have fallen.

@troublebunnie  I oppose gun control because guns in the US are far more protective than destructive - which is borne out by facts.

@Sopor1981 Especially when the control is targeting the very weapons that are least often used: http://t.co/pkuQijbz (a sub-set of rifles)

@Sopor1981 Gun control targeting certain hardware would not reduce anything but lawful use of firearms. History has shown this.

@Sopor1981 Uber-strict gun control would reduce (to some degree) mad men access to guns. But the cost would be increased murder and crime.

@Sopor1981 Because you said 'if the mad men had no gun at all'. That is not obtainable no matter how strict. This is earth, not your utopia.

@Sopor1981 ... controls that only or even primarily impact law abiding sane citizens.

@Sopor1981 Then don't say that gross misrepresentations are merely technicalities when they seriously inhibit honest discussion.

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe That issue is not like you paint it at ALL. Please do some research!

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa But I do think we need more funding for mental health care. Too often prison system is only care.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA On this we also agree! Let's work to improve mental health care and limit gun access by same.

@MushadaMama @carmank1 @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa And just because it is difficult to count, does that make each life saved any less real?

@MushadaMama @carmank1 @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Do seat-belts save lives? How do we know? How do you count a life saved by something?

@MushadaMama @carmank1 @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa And actually, seat belts are a useful analogy on the difficulty of proving a negative.

@MushadaMama @carmank1 @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Oh, I see. The flip side is a car is rarely useful to protect the weak from the powerful

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Please try to pay attention to the topic. Cher wants massacres to stop. I was trying to show ...

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa I can barely keep up with you all with just the current topic. :)

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa I was avoid this particular topic. We can go there if you would like. But I won't do it right now.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Please re-read. I said the founders were clear outside of second amendment about self defense.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa And US murder rate has fallen as gun laws eased. Why do you fight the facts?

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Even if more innocent lives are saved? You know murder rate in UK is higher after guncontrol.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa And history has shown education is better at changing behavior than legislation.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa I have already stated that care is needed due to overzealous prosecutors.

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama Perfect example of #guncontrol failure. Look at what happened in DC: http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@RATM4 @CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama Effectiveness.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA But the right measures could help reduce them. But we are too focused on hardware.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA If you are after stopping the massacres, you will fail. http://t.co/z32dJwBT

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA Similar state laws are frequently abused by overzealous prosecutors to punish lawful gun owners.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA I am not totally opposed to this, but it need tremendous care.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA And outside of the second amendment, the founders were very clear on our right to self-defense

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA No. Sorry. Police have no duty to defend: http://t.co/m6F6exZ1

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Ok. Well, I thank you for your willingness to engage in a civil conversation for a little while.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Not a ridiculous argument at all. Very real harm is prevented every day.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa You are saying that the lives protected by guns are less important because they are not grouped.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Have I said anywhere no laws were needed? I just want effective laws - not feel good laws.

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama Arguable.If mom had practiced safer storage, it could have helped.But what #guncontrol would have?

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa We were talking about punitive laws against gun owners vs education 2 keep guns from being stolen.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa I guess you have given up having a serious discussion?

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama How many women or cops should be beaten to death: http://t.co/v6UDOKst http://t.co/hwEqdD8g

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama Or how many women to be raped: http://t.co/mtDxTI17 Twice by the same guy: http://t.co/hPJogtkd

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama I could ask how many children should be kidnapped: http://t.co/4W2k3Nde

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama They protect people from very real harm - 500,000 per year (govt estimates under Clinton).

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama Because while they are more difficult to count, guns protect lives thousands of time each day.

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe I have used sarcasm to emphasize an illogical accusation against me. I have not been divisive.

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama Because if you are not careful, you could cause very real harm to a lot more people.

@CherDuncombe @DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama You are right, it is emotional. But that is why it is sooo critical to make wise choices.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA Oh, I am sorry. I thought murder lots of people in a crowd was already against the law.  ????

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA Public education campaigns about proper storage, use, etc. Like we do for text while driving.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA You do realize that EVERY law, no matter how well intentioned, has unintended consequences, right?

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA By proposals, I mean proposed laws. It would have to be worded very carefully to avoid abuse.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA And it would disproportionality impact the poor who arguably need access to self defense the most.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA Then it seems to me a thinly veiled ploy to make guns un-affordable.

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe We have our own as well.  ;) http://t.co/E9lJbQVy

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe But I do think that discussion can help us understand the other side and the topic better.

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe When I have such discussions, I never presume I can bring the other side totally into the light.

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe I am always appreciative of a civil discussion. I know this is a complex and contentious issue.

@DispatchesUSA @MushadaMama @CherDuncombe Of course, when you cant win a civil discussion because you lack facts, block away.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Because that has worked soo well to correct behaviors in the US, like drugs, texting while driving

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa I would rather focus on efforts that would actually help.

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa Then, when it doesn't work (who couldn't see that coming) we will have to do something else.

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa No, you want to try to fix it by targeting scary looking guns knowing full well that handguns are used in crime.

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa People will be horrified again and want to DO SOMETHING!!! What will that be? Maybe 6 round magazines?

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa But you want to ban them. Then, when the next shooter kills 30 people using handguns with 10 rnd mags (like VT)

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa Really? Because the real facts show that so called 'assault rifles' are not the issue: http://t.co/pkuQijbz

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa I would have to be written VERY carefully and I think education would be much more effective.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa Many have been used by anti-gun prosecutors to punish lawful citizens.

@MushadaMama @cherduncombe @dispatchesusa I understand the desire. But most proposals are written very poorly and criminalize victims.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA Yes, we teach them by educating them. I could support education campaigns.

@MushadaMama @CherDuncombe @dispatchesusa So the gun owner becomes a criminal when they are victimized by a theft? I don't think so.

@CherDuncombe @MushadaMama @DispatchesUSA To be comparable to cars, it would only be required if carried in public. #justsayin

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa You asked me to start at the beginning, I am just going down the list. I am not the one pushing a stupid analogy

@MushadaMama @dispatchesusa I am not throwing up my hands. I am trying to shift discussion from the pointless to the effective. :)

@Sopor1981 That would indeed be hard. I am not aware of ANY mass shooting in recent history that involved that kind of firepower. #wow!

@Sopor1981 ... access to mental health care. etc. Way too many variables. I can find countries with less guns and more violence.

@Sopor1981 The point is that there are too many variables to try to compare countries outright. Soci-economic, gangs, crime, drugs ...

@HaroldWNelson That's fair. Based upon the evidence I have seen, I still have questions. So I am doubtful as to who was the aggressor.

@HaroldWNelson Again, we need the whole body of evidence. Nothing less will suffice for making a judgement. I want justice to be done also.

@HaroldWNelson It does go to potential aggression for sure. It is NOT by itself man-slaughter. The jury must weigh whole body of evidence.

@HaroldWNelson I believe that his version of events are plausible and that he didn't beat himself senseless. I want to see more evidence.

@HaroldWNelson I haven't seen that evidence so I can't speak to it. (Which is why I say wait to rush judgement and pray for actual Justice.)

@HaroldWNelson But I also think it is possible TM confronted and quickly attacked and in that case, I think GZ is innocent.

@HaroldWNelson And, if TM confronted but GZ did not attempt to de-escalate but rather 'puffed up his chest', then manslaughter sounds right.

@HaroldWNelson Obviously if GZ confronted, he is guilty and should be convicted and serve time for murder.

@HaroldWNelson In my mind, it all depends upon who confronted who AND how both parties reacted to the confrontation.

@HaroldWNelson People are killed with a single punch sometimes. No one should have to a take beating IF they were not an aggressor.

@Sopor1981 I don't know. This guy killed 12 in #guncontrol paradise UK.  http://t.co/eeFx59Nb You really think you could ban all guns in US?

@HaroldWNelson If you don't mind discussing it; How can you be so certain that TM was innocent and GZ was completely guilty?

@HaroldWNelson We shouldn't want justice FOR anyone. It is supposed 2 be blind &amp; when we demand it for someone, we turn it into revenge.

@HaroldWNelson I notice your tagline says "Justice for Trayvon", "Justice for Jordan". I think I understand why, but it bugs me.

@HaroldWNelson BTW, I appreciate the civil discussion. I know this is a contentious, complex, and painful topic.

@dmmmdFLL @moronwatch @LtlRedX Perhaps so. It certainly does not do anything to actually address issue of violent crime or mass harm.

@HaroldWNelson Agreed, HIPPA laws make it challenging. We need mental health professionals to weigh in to the discussion as well.

@HaroldWNelson 2nd, you look at real data and realize that violent crime is actually falling ... it is not on the rise here like in the UK.

@HaroldWNelson 1st, you don't choose options that won't really help and that may actually cause more harm. #guncontrol

@platos_cavern Commandments and Constitution agree ... Thou Shall not Commit Murder. I have no intention of committing murder.

@platos_cavern I don't fear every stranger I walk past. Stupid actions in a car are also permanent. Do you drive?

@platos_cavern Odds of being a victim of violent crime: 1 in 2.4. The facts show your fear is more delusional. (Again, I don't live in fear)

@platos_cavern Odds of being murdered with a gun in US are 1 in 28,532 (which includes gang violence, BTW).

@jeanepeters13 The one thing that is fairly consistent with these mass-killers is that they kill themselves at first resistance.

@jeanepeters13 AND, an armed citizen likely saved lives in Clackamas mall without firing a shot: http://t.co/VTvFBapl

@jeanepeters13 I can understand why that would be a cause for concern ... and yet it is STILL better than no-one being able to resist.

@jeanepeters13 Please read the timeline and tell me you don't think they saved lives: https://t.co/BjA0ucq3

@jeanepeters13 Yes it did - and they saved lives because they were able to respond quickly: http://t.co/PnK2e717

@jeanepeters13 I can't disagree with that. The response is key.

@jeanepeters13 CT shooter had handguns available, VT and Columbine used handguns. Innocents will continue to die in "gun free zones".

@jeanepeters13 Then I find your position untenable. Kids and other innocents will continue to be at the mercy of evil.

@jeanepeters13 So do you support total civilian disarmament?

@jeanepeters13 But that is why I would rather community police officers interacting with our kids daily to metal detectors and checkpoints.

@jeanepeters13 Listen, I am the first to resist police state efforts. I hate the security theater of the TSA at airports.

@jeanepeters13 BTW, I want to say again that I appreciate the civil discourse. I know this is a complex and contentious issue.

@jeanepeters13 I understand your thinking. The problem is, the guns are already there - with or without permission from the state.

@jeanepeters13 Regarding armed teachers: I find the arguments against it untenable.  Nobody is wanting to (cont) http://t.co/0YA5tCHW

@jeanepeters13 I trust the facts that show people with mental illness don't ask permission from the state to carry a weapon where they want.

@jeanepeters13 So to all of the existing school districts with police presence for all these years, that has created more problems?

@jeanepeters13 No, I don't think MORE guns are the answer. I think that allowing vetted citizens to defend themselves with guns will help.

@jeanepeters13 I love that, MORE Guns ... like we just want them to fall out of sky into a mixing bowl and stir the pot.

@jeanepeters13 Not to mention that Bill Clinton requested this exact thing when he was president. Still think its a dumb ass idea?

@Ringuette History shows that most mass shooters kill themselves the moment they face resistance. Even recent history like Clackamas mall.

@Ringuette I disagree and haven't seen any data on this. Data shows that when shooters meet resistance, less people are killed.

@Ringuette Advocating for funding for more ISD police, as others from both side of the isle have done, helps the firearms industry?

@GoPr1 So, as a Genuine question .. I will try to address - but it will be more than 140 characters.  lol

@GoPr1 But that could lead to working toward policies that would actually help, so the link is solid.as you stated it - so i can stand on it

@GoPr1 Close. I was really trying 2 say we could get a lot further in the 'national discussion' if average gun owners weren't misrepresented

@GoPr1 Ahhh, no. You should go back and re-read the tweets. That was not implied and I don't see how it could have been inferred.

@GoPr1 Wow. Reread your own tweet and I think, if you can follow it, you will have your answer.

@GoPr1 I see. So a joke about getin educatin sum dum hicks is funny- but pointing out the implied stereotyping has somehow crossed the line?

@GoPr1 No. I think it might break some stereotypes about the typical gun owner and offer insights on the protective value of guns.

@debralynnlazar It would pass then another tragedy using handguns would occur &amp; people would still be shocked. Short of a near total ban ...

@Amberfire287 Unfortunately, it is way easier to count number of lives lost but much harder to count lives saved, rapes prevented, etc.

@debralynnlazar The point is still valid. Rigid controls can reduce but not eliminate mass killings and don't always lower violent crime.

@debralynnlazar @motherjones First of all, only one mass shooting has occurred when citizens are allowed to be legally armed. Only one.

@KEmordi But I was actually referring to the hundreds of thousands of people saved from harm each year by defensive gun uses.

@KEmordi Actually if nations are analogous to individuals, then you are correct. Nukes have served as a deterrent during our entire lifetime

@melodyisdestiny You are 100% correct. I withdraw my snarky comment and offer an apology. I also abhor improper gun storage around children.

@Political_Bill @starincali No, it is because bureaucrats are more concerned about $$ liability than actual safety.

Funny, did you even read the article? RT @dhamburger: Mass Killings Occur in the US once every two weeks--- #guncontrol http://t.co/TqC7KO2E

@Amberfire287 Agreed.

@Amberfire287 But some will and many result in criminal being arrested or killed preventing future crimes that can never be measured.

@Amberfire287 In same period there will be at least 9600 defensive gun uses - most without firing. But not all of those will save a life.

@Amberfire287 I can't say for sure. There are about 12k non-suicide gun-deaths/yr (about 80% gang related). That would be about 230 per week

@Amberfire287 True - I can't disagree with that. But CDC studies show at least 500,000 defensive gun uses/yr - they defend at lot

@mitchlangberg ... Even government studies (like CDC in 1994 under Clinton and dems) show 500,000 defensive gun uses per year #gunssavelives

@matthiasrascher @deucelow2 Probably true. But would result in more suffering as guns also allow the weak to defend against the powerful.

@iamalik_ @deucelow2 2. Last time I checked, no one has protected themselves or family from harm by using a shoebomb. #gunssavelives

@iamalik_ @deucelow2 1. That is a huge 4th amendment violation that IS NOT keeping us safe #securitytheater

@deucelow2 Nice, so you RT my one tweet the #guncontrol *may have* reduced violent crime - but ignore the UK, Germany, US failures.

@Amberfire287 I can't explain why it seems to have worked in AU, but not UK, Germany, many US states.  Again, cultural or other differences.

@DamienMcKenna Why not, instead, focus on the real issue - #mentalhealth ? What about this proposal: http://t.co/7XkHch1d

@DamienMcKenna ... and would not stop the shootings - might reduce the damage, but not stop.  (I won't even mention govt tyranny aspects)

@DamienMcKenna Your proposals would reduce citizen ability to protect self - in some cases significantly, cost a ton of $$# to monitor ...

@DamienMcKenna That is the one I use in public - but I don't use it at home - the larger one is more appropriate - or a shotgun.

@Amberfire287 Here are a list of some shootings outside of the US: http://t.co/bd4ZnQBF

@Amberfire287 Germany has still had school shootings despite very tight gun control laws. I have already talked about UK.

@Amberfire287 Good find!! AU seems to be one of the only places with good evidence that #guncontrol may have reduced violent crime.

@Amberfire287 And most of the hundreds of thousands of defensive gun uses in the US occur without ever firing a shot.

@Amberfire287 Possibly true. But nothing equalizes force between a 100 lb women and a 300 lb man as well as firearms.

@Amberfire287 Guns aren't only factor preventing crime, but are a major factor. What does it say? That some evil must be faced with force.

@Amberfire287 First, I want to thank you for continuing to engage in this civil conversation. My main hope is to show it is a complex issue.

@DamienMcKenna What if I am traveling? What about my wife/family? Instead of  #guncontrol - why not tackle the actual problem? #mentalhealth

@DamienMcKenna Let me ask - you plan - limit number by person, household, what?  What do I do if my ONE gun needs to be serviced?

@DamienMcKenna Not true. I can't adequately conceal my larger gun in public. I don't want to be arrested for intentional failure to conceal.

@DamienMcKenna I can't argue with that. It also would be different if he had #mentalhealth care he needed or if anyone else had been armed.

@DamienMcKenna That is why gangs and home invasions involving 3 and 4 people are relevant here.

@DamienMcKenna You are trying 2 prevent massacres - but your plan would limit the citizens ability to defend self against more than one thug

@DamienMcKenna Agreed - just giving an example that sometimes 6 shots is not enough even if it is just one badguy - more so if more than one

@DamienMcKenna lol - BTW, I want to thank you for the civil discussion on the difficult and complex issue.

@DamienMcKenna Sometimes guns break and need to be repaired. I use a different gun to protect my home than the one I carry in public.

@DamienMcKenna Yes, even police have failed to stop some criminals with 15, 20 rounds. Many crimes are committed by a group of thugs.

@DamienMcKenna How many would she be allowed to have? How many does it take to kill defenseless children?

@blanket @andytobo All of CT guns were licensed. Licensing guns and/or owners won't stop anything. But I do like licensing for public carry.

@blanket @andytobo And licensing is a proven failure. Canada gave it up - too $$$. In 50+ years in Hawaii (which is Island) no crimes solved

@blanket @andytobo But, I do have concerns about new websites that link strangers for priv sells. I don't have an answer, but am concerned.

@blanket @andytobo 2. Some private parties have wanted access to NCIS checks but there is no mechanism other than going through FFL.

@blanket @andytobo Regarding traditional private sales: 1. I don't know that I want the gov. in my personal transactions with friends &amp; fam

@blanket @andytobo That is a red-herring. Look at this DOJ study: http://t.co/vCWvOvvD &lt; 1% of inmates who used gun got it from gunshow.

@andytobo @blanket 100% true. All the more reason to ensure you are not disarming the innocent (and the sane).

@jamesmthomson Very good point - profound actually. The federalist papers caused quite a stir, didn't they?

@andytobo @blanket But either way, I want to thank you for a civil discussion. This is a very complex and painful issue.

@andytobo @blanket Any proposed change should be weighed against liberty &amp; careful to avoid unintended, hard to measure, but very real harm.

@andytobo @blanket I am not saying nothing can be done. But many proposals would do very little to address problem and could cause harm.

@andytobo @blanket Like the UK which now has skyrocketing violent crime: http://t.co/9vivukbX and D.C -&gt; improving http://t.co/9vivukbX

@andytobo @blanket Rather, you have to look at what happens to crime rates in a region after #guncontrol laws are changed.

@andytobo @blanket It doesn't take variances re: drugs, crime, gangs, access to mental health care into account. #notscientific too many var

@andytobo @blanket No. Trying to compare countries directly fails to take into account cultural and socio-economic differences.

@jamesmthomson That seems consistent with some of the quotes, but others are clear re: self-defense and protection from tyranny within.

@andytobo @blanket Stacked question. Let me ask you how many families and homes should be a mercy of evil so you can *think* we are safer?

@andytobo @blanket Thank you. ... So would you deny this mother protected her daughter from great harm? http://t.co/4W2k3Nde

@andytobo @blanket Hmm. But there was also no evidence that cigarettes offered protection to the weak from the powerful.

@jamesmthomson Why do you think they did spelled it out?

@EmilyMiller Would you consider digging into this story some? http://t.co/VTvFBapl It would be great if it could be corroborated. #tipline

@jamesmthomson That seem to ring a bell in the dusty corners of my mind - but I can't say I recall it.

@jamesmthomson Good question. I guess I would think it was to calm fears. They were trying to step out from under the thumb of the King.

@jamesmthomson "The great object is that every man be armed." and "Everyone who is able may have a gun."

@jamesmthomson "The best we can help for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed."

@jamesmthomson "To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them."

@jamesmthomson "I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people."

@jamesmthomson Yes, for the security of the free state.

@jamesmthomson But any proposed change should be weighed against liberty &amp; careful to avoid unintended, hard to measure, but very real harm.

@jamesmthomson ... speaks of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So I agree there are limitations.

@jamesmthomson While the 2nd is the only one that states 'shall not be infringed' - I agree with you because the constitution itself ...

@vtho_nguyen Yes, they do - certainly. But they also make is possible for the weak to defend against the powerful. #complexissue

@jamesmthomson Ok, sorry. That seemed to be what you were implying. It is no doubt a very complex issue. But self-defense is also a right.

@Amberfire287 Like this mom who would have lost her daughter to a kidnapper if she did not have means of self-defense. http://t.co/FLibVXlF

@Amberfire287  There are, of course, other factors. I mainly want stress that gun control can have unintended consequences.

@Amberfire287 Compare that to how crime in Washington DC fell after gun bans were overturned: http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@Amberfire287 Good observation. UK once had very very low rates of violent crime as shown on this graph: http://t.co/ZKYBG5CW

@luca_passani BTW, I really appreciate the civil discussion. We are after the same goal in the end.

@jamesmthomson To pretend that guns are the only difference is what is insane - especially when opposite laws have had opposite results.

@jamesmthomson Yes, but here are still many difference 2 explain that gap. Culture, gangs and drugs, economics, access to mental health care

@luca_passani Yes, on that we certainly agree. I want to keep them from getting shot, murdered, raped, kidnapped, etc. As many as possible.

@luca_passani Perhaps, but not a large increase. None that would keep this mother from defending her daughter: http://t.co/2orKMUB7

@luca_passani 'course there is confirmation bias - always is. Why do you think gun-control proponents count 'gun-deaths' instead of murders?

@jamesmthomson Whatever the base rates were, US crime is dropping, UK crime is getting worse.

@jamesmthomson No and yes. Murder rate is lower but overall violent crime is higher. I am more saying our rates are going opp. directions.

@MoanaMD @Avaaz Without access to a gun, this Mom would have lost her daughter to a kidnapper:  http://t.co/FLibVXlF

@MoanaMD @Avaaz The law should try to protect but it can only do so much. People have the right to self defense.

@MoanaMD @Avaaz I think there are many, many, many factors. Cultural, economic, access to mental health care ... you can't compare outright.

@jamesmthomson It is a very very complex issue - no doubt.  I appreciate the civil discussion about it.

@jamesmthomson No, it more like someone who went from 500 to 300 explaining his diet to someone who went from 200 to 300.

@jamesmthomson Good question ... lol. Because the UK used to have low violent crime rates - comparatively.

@MoanaMD @Avaaz We don't, But we also don't want to see more suffering that would occur when you disarm the weak and the innocent.

@markaduffy @SnowdropSign Mark, I understand what you are tying to do but I think it is misguided. UK violent way up: http://t.co/9vivukbX

@luca_passani UK for example has had violent crime explosion: http://t.co/9vivukbX while DC crime rartes have fallen http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@luca_passani Rather, you have to look at what happens to crime rates in a region after #guncontrol laws are changed.

@luca_passani Trying to compare countries (or states) directly fails to take into account cultural and socio-economic differences.

@jamesmthomson Rather, you have to look at what happens to crime rates in a region after #guncontrol laws are changed. @MikeRobbinsUSA

@jamesmthomson Trying to compare countries directly fails to take into account cultural and socio-economic differences. @MikeRobbinsUSA

@jamesmthomson Yes, US murder rate is about 4x higher than UK - but the gap used to be bigger. US rate has fallen while UK rate has raised.

@jamesmthomson Because @MikeRobbinsUSA is talking about violent crime and murder but you keep limiting it to murder-by-gun.

@jamesmthomson @MikeRobbinsUSA Did you know that while US crime rates are falling, UK is now more violent than US? http://t.co/9vivukbX

@jamesmthomson @MikeRobbinsUSA Are you saying that murder-by-gun is the only murder we should count?

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions Thanks for tip - it looks like a great devotional. I will have to pick it up.  Peace.

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions Thank you for your time and for a civil discussion. It is a very complex issue.

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions I understand. I dislike it also. My heart is broken. I just want to prevent worse harm from more innocents.

@MaldoIsKing You forgot the column counting lives saved, rapes prevented, kidnappings stopped.

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions US has expanded gun rights and crime rates have fallen.  UK did the opposite and is now more violent.

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions You have to look at what happens to crime rates in a region after #guncontrol laws are changed.

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions Try to compare countries fails to take into account cultural and socio-economic differences.

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions Look how well #guncontrol has been working for the citizens in the UK: http://t.co/9vivukbX

@ArieKreyveldt @jneproductions 1. Don't confuse 'gun deaths' with homicide rates 2. Our crime rate has been dropping - others not so much.

@notBPgas @Alexbeck90 And yet the UK now has some of the highest rates of violent crime and murder: http://t.co/9vivukbX

@jneproductions You are so misguided. The blood many more innocents will be lost if you disarm the weak and the innocent. #guncontrol

@luca_passani Ok, I am all ears?

@luca_passani I don't disagree with that at all, but it is independent from self defense.

@ziadrazak Hopefully because it is a complex issue and can have unintended consequences that cost more lives.

@LouArab BTW, I want to thank you for the civil discussion. My heart breaks over this tragedy. My hope is to try to prevent worse tragedy.

@luca_passani And that would result in thousands of deaths of innocent people who are unable to defend themselves. #notsimpleatall

@Amberfire287 Emi, we don't have to imagine. Other countries have tried it and thing end up worse: http://t.co/9vivukbX

@LouArab Here is where total gun control finally ends up: http://t.co/9vivukbX

@LouArab I found these crime trends for Canada. As best I can tell it is from a non-gun related org. http://t.co/YdI7U4Lu

@LouArab I can think of exactly zero policy organizations on guns that are not biased. Can you?

@LouArab This study says no: http://t.co/cAV2mojJ http://t.co/Dc3Yt7Ms

@LouArab I don't know. Again cultural differences cloud the issue. Instead, you should ask if gun control has improved crime rates in CA?

@LouArab Culture, drug and gang prominence, suicide. 55% of gun deaths are suicide. About 80% of the rest are gang related.

@LouArab No, instead U put fresh apples in each bowl and see what happens in time. That's why look for deltas after #guncontrol law changes.

@LouArab You come upon 2 bowls of apples, blue one full of rotten apples and yellow one full of ripe apples - did the blue bowl cause decay?

@LouArab Try to compare countries fails to take into account cultural and socio-economic differences.  That is practically useless.

@LouArab Do you want total or by population comparison? Mexico comes to mind (which has total ban, BTW). But nation comparing is misleading

@supraman1z I don't know if you attempting sarcasm or not and it is a bit off topic - but yeah, actually, they do. #history

@LouArab The important measure is what happens in a given region AFTER a #guncontrol law is changed - like in D.C. http://t.co/yzUvrjDx

@LouArab And I can point to countries where the reverse is true - because there is no accounting for cultural and socio-eco differences.

@LouArab @A1CandyCaneLane It's not the only argument - many of the #guncontrol measures sought would endanger thousands of people.

@Steve_Johnson42 @the__nick Just as sickening to hear calls for measures that will endanger more innocent people. #complicatedissue

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar I am not angry at all. I appreciate ur time. My general goal is not 2 convince, but 2 educate. For example ...

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar Yes, 140 characters is very limiting. Very difficult to go in-depth. I feel your pain.

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar Again, I assume you mean registration when you say regulation. How would registration have stopped AZ and VT?

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar They are regulated already - you want them registered. If it works, why did Canada end their registration?

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar 2. Gun reg. cost tons of money and is ineffective - ask Canada and Hawaii. It wouldn't have stopped this guy.

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar 1. Car registration is about taxes, not safety. Cough medicine is a misguided attempt to stop crack.

@howlingbeast @debralynnlazar There are already SOME controls. So you really mean is you want MORE controls. Right?

@debralynnlazar @howlingbeast Then I won't bother trying 2 convince U. But I hope U do understand #guncontrol has unintended consequences.

@debralynnlazar @howlingbeast As I said before, it is a complex issue. Guns make it easy 4 people 2 do bad things, but they also save lives.

@debralynnlazar @howlingbeast Hmm. Ask this Mom if she prefers warm sentiments over the gun that saved her daughter. http://t.co/4K7L6nty

@Ringuette U shouldn't get to call urself 'pro-choice' if you don't give citizens the choice to defend themselves, or 2 drink 32 oz soda's.

@ShitGunNutsSay And I would ask, what can we do, including allowing people to defend themselves, as I think that is part of the answer.

@ShitGunNutsSay because they are the most neutral that I have found - they do list "warts" from both sides - but not completely w/o bias.

@ShitGunNutsSay "impossible to have unbiased statistics" I agree completely- which is very frustrating.  As I mentioned, I do like justfacts

@ShitGunNutsSay I assume less much less than that as usually they are scared away by display of weapon.

@ShitGunNutsSay And if DGU are in the millions, he assumes that hundreds of thousands of criminals would have been shot. Why?

@ShitGunNutsSay Also, just look at methodology: "none of the [detainees] reported being wounded by a "law-abiding citizen"  Really? Shocker!

RT @lindsey_kolb: If Obama loses he can then give speeches and play golf. If he wins he can then give speeches and play golf. #tcot

@ShitGunNutsSay So unless then number of DGU's has dropped drastically, they are still far far more protective than destructive.

@ShitGunNutsSay I was using recent Brady campaign figures for gun deaths and then the 1993 figures for DGU from justfacts for my math.

@HeyHeyNRA Nope. In fact, I used to hold many views similar to yours. Then I started using critical thinking skills.

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 And there we have it! No intellectual honesty. Ascribing the worst traits to those you oppose.

@HeyHeyNRA Well, you can think that with no proof.  My experience tells me otherwise. (Although also with no proof) :)

@TineScath @mpf2011 Funny though, it didn't fall as fast as US murder rate during same period while our violent crime rate has fallen.

@mpf2011 @tinescath @politicomm Now that is a completely different rabbit trail - is it not?

@TineScath @mpf2011 Simply untrue. You have no numbers or facts to support that claim.

@mpf2011 @tinescath @politicomm And yet, they are used protectively hundreds of thousands of times each year without killing anyone.

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 Ok, so for them perhaps it is hypocritical if they are also pro-life.

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 Ok?? I'm not sure what that means. Do they believe guns are more protective or not?

@mpf2011 @tinescath @politicomm Agreed.  I just wanted to establish that as a basis.  Thank you for being intellectually honest.

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 No, they would have to use critical thinking skills to see that crimes that don't happen don't make the news

@mpf2011 @TineScath @politicomm England's escalating violent crime rate says otherwise. Violent Crime is way up since gun control began.

@TineScath Not if they believe that guns are far more protective than destructive. It is not then hypocritical. #intellectualhonesty

@mpf2011 @tinescath @politicomm And I can give you numerous anecdotes of shootings by those who could not legally get guns. #nodifference

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 They are often used to kill people - no contention there. They are just MORE often used to protect lives.

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 See, that is assuming that you have to fire a gun for it to be protective. #simplynottrue

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 So you won't answer that simple question? Is it still hypocrisy if they believe guns are more protective?

@TineScath @PolitiComm @mpf2011 That's a topic we can dig into if you like. But if the belief is there, then there is no hypocrisy. Right?

@PolitiComm @Mikeb302000 @mpf2011 Perhaps its because we see guns save far more lives. U may not agree - but that doth not a hypocrite make.

RT @StevieJWest: &lt;== On pins and needles to hear from Nanny Bloomberg what new gun law will magically deter a criminal from committin ...

@HeyHeyNRA RE: money - sure it is a factor in everything - but you are dead wrong about it not being about 2A and liberty.

@HeyHeyNRA Wikipedia list 30 manuf's of AR-15 variants http://t.co/uvsxSYxd Even more manuf's of SA handguns. No way your plan would work.

@HeyHeyNRA ?? So you agree that military base gun-ban is driven by politics and not safety. #thatwasourtopic

@HeyHeyNRA Perhaps, but I doubt it. And it won't matter, because many wont get the choice - the govt standardizes and would only pick a few.

@HeyHeyNRA In fact, the military has always been congress special little social experiment playground. Always!!!

@HeyHeyNRA BS. Just like big city cops, military brass get caught in political circus. I was a U.S. Marine, trust me I know.

@HeyHeyNRA No, but the government cannot award contracts to all guncos either ... so some of them, many of them, will simply not even try.

@Janasss @bradybuzz Perhaps. But it still has a higher murder rate and a higher overall crime rate ... because ... #gunssavelives

@gopfirecracker More like TROLOLOL

@HeyHeyNRA Perhaps one day you will become the student of history that you aspire to be: http://t.co/0YFWS6Qv #rkba #2A #liberty

@HeyHeyNRA So Military base policy should be considered the gold standard? The Ford Hood shooting should have had a different outcome!

@Janasss ?? Merely highlighting the FACT that his sarcastic portrait is a cousin to Switzerland whose crime rates are the envy of the world.
