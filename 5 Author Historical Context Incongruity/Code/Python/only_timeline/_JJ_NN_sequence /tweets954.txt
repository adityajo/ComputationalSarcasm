@MartySmithESPN who were the 3 "judges"?

@SabresBuzz he should be!  Great trade and potential top 2 pick this year....#movinonup

@SabresBuzz isn't this RJ's last season? Or is it next year?

@SabresBuzz agree.  I just love how Murray has handled this team.  #trust #hockeyheaven #OneBuffalo

@SabresBuzz he isn't in any position to make those type of "demands", Murray is his own man and will make the best decision for the future.

@NASCARONFOX apparently all you need is an accusation to be presumed guilty...

@PatWGR Zadorov a scratch tonight??

@MartySmithESPN if appeal is won, I would assume it's "follow the leader".  #NASCAR and it should be won.

@stacycrickman @MartySmithESPN @TonyStewart I respect your opinion, just don't agree with punishment without proof.

@stacycrickman @MartySmithESPN @TonyStewart -what ever happened to "innocent until proven guilty"? Can't prove intent in video, law&gt;claim

@stacycrickman @MartySmithESPN let the legal system play out, then punish if necessary.  Just like they did with @TonyStewart last year.

@stacycrickman @MartySmithESPN disagree....if u were accused of assault...would u want to be punished if there was no proof or charges? #law

@lwdji_ @SHR1410414fan @TonyStewart @NASCARONFOX 

@stacycrickman @MartySmithESPN the difference is that there is no proof, evidence or charges...#slippery slope #NASCAR

@TonyStewart was "accused" of intentionally running over a driver.@NASCARONFOX #NASCAR let the legal process play out.why is this different?

@MartySmithESPN I would!! No charges, no proof, just a claim from a psycho chick.  What happened to "innocent till proven guilty"? #NASCAR

@tomjensen100 wow! Not a fan of his but no charges filed! What r they doing? This seems to be jumping the gun. Let it play out! #NASCAR

@JeremyWGR I'll take two also!! Even tho it's tough to watch now

@JeremyWGR thanks!!!

@JeremyWGR never got to hear the "marshmallow" story

@_TylerBurnett yep.  They did.  Fist change in many years.  Still doesn't compare.  If a non-win driver wins cup..rules will change again.

@_TylerBurnett different sport and they don't change the format every few to gain attention/fans. I was ok with the chase, this..not so much

@_TylerBurnett consistently average..neither even came close to a win (if memory serves) and yep,Believe Matt was the last to win one

@_TylerBurnett @JeffGordonWeb @JimmieJohnson @DaleJr @keselowski there are a minimum o 19 wins missing from the championship race. #nascar

@_TylerBurnett true. But Newman, Kenseth, and except for his 1 win, Hamlin were ghosts all season.Harvick is my pic b/c he actually competed

@_TylerBurnett except that the 4-5 best drivers all season have no chance at the title!!  @JeffGordonWeb @JimmieJohnson @DaleJr @keselowski

@Racer24 @23mikeb @PPistone @TheMikeBagley not a fan of this format at all..the best drivers all season aren't eligible.  At least 19 wins

@SBNation @JimmySpencerNBA he is such a loudmouth idiot.  #nicemath

@JaySkurski @salmaiorana I agree.., but he'd prob get in trouble for saying that too.

@Tjmajors @jdthumma I agree @MartinsvilleSwy is my favorite by far! Great view, great action and great people.  Been there twice. Will again

@jdthumma race was fine tho

@jdthumma I guess. I camp at every track I go to so I couldn't speak for the hotel situations.  Tho I didn't see many on the ride

@jdthumma @NHMS offered me free outlaws tix if I went back..wasn't interested.  Our kids were scared of the attendants. Last time I go there

@jdthumma though to nail down on twitter but the camping attendants were nasty, threatening and ignorant.  Talked to @NHMS about it but nada

@FanOnTheStreet u r free to your opinion.  Just think common sense would have let the legal system figure it out, not figure out a death

@JeremyWGR he's an "honest" player according to Torts.

@hsimon62 Richards should get a game so he can learn how to stay on his feet when he gets pushed again. He barely pushed him and he crumbled

@BuffNewsVogl how funny that Staal said he doesn't back it up, and sits on the bench.  Clearly he knows.

@PatrickMoranBSD did I miss something? He said he played for the stars

@SportsnetSpec do the research before mentioning all of his "hits from behind for ages".  It's actually not at all something he does

@BNHarrington my point is, I dont have to buy the paper because its online.  Just read @TBNSully s Pommer article. Saved myself $2.50.

@BNHarrington I can read them online if I choose.  But sports news is available when it happens, you should know. We r using it now

@pham1717 u r correct.  I was thinking if the other game.  Not the Habs.

@pham1717 been wanting that for a while but the last game seemed like an big improvement.  Could this be bad for him now? He was moving well

@pham1717 @bnharrington within the game.  I bet lindy would love to be able to just keep him out the the whole game but game dictates that.

@pham1717 @bnharrington agreed Paul.  It's not as easy as some would seem to just "give" a player more minutes. It has to do with situations
