@MooreyMoore bad thing about this country having to pay for higher education more like.. should take a leaf from Germany's book!

@MooreyMoore sucks for you tbh. yep I'm sure it'll work out :)

@MooreyMoore yeah I'll have to see about that though, it ain't cheap flying to Australia

@MooreyMoore haven't been on holiday for like 8 years.. this is long overdue !

@MooreyMoore unfortunately it's gonna be overflowing already

@MooreyMoore yup me too but this might be unintentional, it's gonna be awesome. Uncle bought a boat this week :)

@MooreyMoore not that you'll be more Scottish, you'll just decipher us easier.. besides I might have a slight Aussie accent next semester 😜

@MooreyMoore well I doubt that hahah!

@MooreyMoore this is Scotland 😉 catch up

@MooreyMoore I totally did not make that connection 😣

@MooreyMoore I like Moore, very official, proper.. A dance?!

@MooreyMoore it's sentimental, I'm Miller and my sister is Mini-Miller.. But I like nicknames :)

@MooreyMoore if only it could just be Miller 😔 ...

@MooreyMoore don't jinx me, Moore.. my knees are playing up. It's more the fact it was raining heavily which made the ground slippy!

@MooreyMoore you'd be surprised at some places the caches are actually.. one today was right next to a hidden drop :)

@MooreyMoore lol, it'd bet it's either geocaching or shinty so there's that.. You'll be fine

@MooreyMoore jeez shinty-hurling... I'd be watching YouTube vids if I were you! Good luck. But also Hev will patch you up if you get injured

@MooreyMoore ah it shouldn't be too bad! just don't get hit either, last week someone's ankle looked terrible..
