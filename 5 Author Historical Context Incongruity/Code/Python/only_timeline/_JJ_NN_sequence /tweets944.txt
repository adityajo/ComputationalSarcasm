The fact that you can never be sure if your idols are like that all the time or pretend to be someone else makes me sad.

I love how we all freak out because someone else met Liz! aslkdjfl!

RT @9GAG: Twitter is basically just you having a conversation with yourself and hoping that someone else will join in.
