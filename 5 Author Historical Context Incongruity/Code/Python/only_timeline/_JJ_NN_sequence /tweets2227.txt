Shane gave me his credit card to buy myself Christmas presents 😍😍😍😍

checking my credit card balances was a fast way to ruin my day 😫

Something Borrowed is on at one. Perfect for this lazy snow day. 🕐❄️

RT @erikacioncii: Perfect day to break in the Burberry boots😈☔👢

just got my platinum credit card with a $5,000 limit in the mail 😍

RT @BBSurba: Perfectly content with not going down the shore. Keep the craziness away from me.

RT @AndreaMalizia: Perfect http://t.co/fTpOWvDk

RT @Itscolleenkelly: Maybe I shouldn't have got a credit card right before Christmas..
