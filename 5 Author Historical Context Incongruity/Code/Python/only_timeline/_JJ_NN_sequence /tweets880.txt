@ToroJunior24 lol in feel like I really missed something here today

@PegLegReport @TravisHerzing can't wait to see what you come up with for that.   How about this? http://t.co/Yqoq1GAeaW

@PegLegReport @TravisHerzing well there's something for all of us to look forward to.  For different reasons I'm sure

@PegLegReport nothing to be sorry about.  Ur mind is just clouded.  You'll come around.

@PegLegReport no stat for that. his job is to field balls n save runs. Not sure why u and boras think he should b rewarded for mediocracy.

@PegLegReport @TravisHerzing that's a good point.  Maybe he juices right after he gets tested.  That would explain streakiness

@PegLegReport lolsy

@PegLegReport act. that still has him as 2nd most RBI in NL for 3B. guess I would approve of him being an AS.  ONLY 4 HR derby purposes tho

@PegLegReport just to wrap things up.  His errors translated to 11 runs given up. Soooo he nets about 40 RBI     Good for about 40th in MLB

@PegLegReport haha thats it? that was pretty boring.   I was hopin for a little more fire.  Considering the conv. started w "*were" and all

@PegLegReport i mean he's NL player of the week for sure.  Player of the month at best

@PegLegReport are you fully aware that ally is 3rd in batting average?

@PegLegReport what do you do on your off day?

@PegLegReport not gonna lie...I only just recently started giving him credit for anything at all.   Maybe I will work up to that.

@PegLegReport I'm really not trying to sound ignorant.

@PegLegReport can't and shouldnt lean on anyone every game. But it'd be nice to be able to count on him when they need it.

@PegLegReport but yea I wouldnt hate it if he ended up at .254 with 30 hr and 85 RBI. I would love it.

@PegLegReport it's just that he's so streaky. The team can never lean on him because he is a different person every game.
