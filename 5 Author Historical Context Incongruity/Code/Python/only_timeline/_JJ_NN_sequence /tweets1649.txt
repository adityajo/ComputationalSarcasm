@PeetysTraining @jessicaViv who said he had 2 "kiss girls asses?" maybe just not SO arrogant, insensitive... he'd NEVER been there w/out her

@MichaelStag just a word of advice-when telling a girl ur not interested just b str8t up honest even if the truth hurts it's AAAAALWAYS best

@PeetysTraining WWJD? dont think that it was HIM giving you strength to do that to @RachTrue_ i'm guessing JC is displeased w/ ur actions :(

@PeetysTraining You may have won the money, but u lost much more...

@PeetysTraining What about to leave with a LITTLE integrity in tact? Guess not.

@PeetysTraining  ALSO if @RachTrue_ wasn't "all in" as ur partner, Y did she "betray" her BFF?? Wasn't that proof enough 4 ur arrogant ass?

@seansmommy83  Is retweeting this admission that you feel bad @MichaelStag ? ;)

@PeetysTraining Ive watched alot of &lt;3break on bach/bachelorette/bp... but nothing compares to what you did. shameful.

@PeetysTraining Nope, never dreamed that you'd weasel your way into the money. You did nothing 2 get there. You just HAPPENED 2b w/ Rachel.

@BachtteWetpaint At least he admits he's a SCHMUCK.

@JessicaViv @PeetysTraining Brilliant? What's more "high school" than backstabbing and acting like an arrogant jerk? That'd be Nick.

@PeetysTraining I used 2 think u were the quiet nice guy who hung back now I am shocked 2 learn ur an arrogant jerk who only cares 4 himself

@TGHMikeM I dunno about other viewers, but Stephanie lost my vote 2night the game is constantly changing as players show their true selves!

@TGHKevin You'll come back Kevin! I have faith! You have to come back and battle the "others"!!

@heyemo then I noticed I had one less I was "following" and its her. I tweeted that I loved her on the show. Guess that was a bad idea?

@heyemo Yah, I thought it was weird. It's Chantal from the Bach. Her Tweets are private, and she allowed me to follow her...

@TenleyMolzahn I don't know what I did before DVR!

@TaylorLofficial @janel_eden Braveheart is a good one.
