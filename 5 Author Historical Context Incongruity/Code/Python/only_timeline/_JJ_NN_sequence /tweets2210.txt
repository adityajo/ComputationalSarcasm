The one thing I learned in class: don't try to save money by eating cat food.  You will get scurvy.

You just a dog walker

You get a lot of weird looks when skateboarding on the brick road in front of the hub.  I know I'm loud,  get over it.

The chick in my lab group forgot to feed our rat. You literally have one fucking job.

You never have the right to think you're better than anyone.

I'm sorry rushing for a sorority is not grounds for having a pissing contest with me. You chose to do that.
