@trialandaaron @RivalNick @902BryanFraser that's always your fave hiding place for dead bodies isn't it?

@RivalNick @trialandaaron @902BryanFraser dismember!! Cut them into little pieces. However if it was Hannah sized there may be a problem.

Just saw someone go into Midnight Fantasy lolololololol

I want Seoul Food.

@902BryanFraser @trialandaaron do it friday night. Or saturday.

I just saw @902BryanFraser at Wendy's, so I made a face at him. The window person was like "Um wat?".

@902BryanFraser that's what you should tell her then.

@902BryanFraser well then need to appeal to younger audiences Mr. Fraser.

Fancy game night tomorrow. @SandyMuscles @RivalNick @trialandaaron

I wanna watch Finding Nemo.

@Eric__McMurray it's a burden we must carry for being good dungeon masters. :)

Been sitting in East Sides for 15 minutes and have no gotten drinks yet. WTF?

Work done! Food times!!

Made me some rainbow cake. :)

Can everyone just please look up and watch the music video for Fashion is my Kryptonite and understand that this is actually the worst song.

Why am I always too early. FML.

Why is it that when I have to work I can't get out of bed but when I don't I can't sleep. Fuck you body.

So I randomly got 30 facebook messages this morning from my inbox. Some were from Feb. Nice to get those 6 months later.

Feeling sooo much better today. Not even taking Ibuprofen.

"Do we have any vaseline at home?" "For your hole?" Just saw a vaseline commercial and this is all I thought of lol.

@lesleymaclean its normal for us. :)

Aaron wanted me to see his poop. This is what awaited me. http://t.co/zkNqdFVu

@trialandaaron only for @FishIainLens cause I don't give a hoot that he didn't want to dress up LOLOLOLOL!!

Fancy game night tonight.

I'm early for work. Here with the cleaners FML I hope they don't talk to me. #sogross #takeashowerhelga

"That carpets the only thing you'll lay Carl." "Fuck off Jesus."

@RivalNick I like Final Fantasy XIII but I hate the battle system. How you have to wait for the bar to fill. I know you can cancel it but ya

I'm kinda liking Final Fantasy XIII. It's kinda like Fire Emblem, Kingdom Hearts and Tales of Symphonia rolled into one.

I cannot hack it when Hughes dies in FullMetal Alchemist. #cryfest

@trialandaaron @FishIainLens remember how one of you asked Geoff to go gay for him yesterday? The message went to his Mom. LOL!! Wrong #!!

Zellers has two cashiers open WTF? Apparently they love pissing people off.

@FishIainLens because if you get asparagus with it it's a party!

Finally off work. Gonna play me some Dragon Age II. #nerdparty #dungeonmaster

Apparently Matthew cannot go to sleep by himself, so he is continually asking me when we can go to bed. WTF go to bed now. Sweet jesus.

Sometimes @FishIainLens is a very nice little brother. I love you. ♥

@FishIainLens come over and bring pretzels.
