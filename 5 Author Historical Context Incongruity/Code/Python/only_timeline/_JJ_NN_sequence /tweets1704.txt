@youronlyhuman14 Don't cry, please, you said it yourself: the best is yet to come. Please keep believing in that!

@CSIMorganders Don't worry, honey, please don't! It's sweet, but I don't want you worrying over me!

Don't worry, I won't ask you which I should do first, I think I kinda have an idea! ;)

RT @SeaWorld: Don't you think so? http://t.co/E7SqE0salf

@youronlyhuman14 Don't worry, you're not alone, it's definitely not my fave ep either!

RT @SeaWorld: Don't you think so? http://t.co/hqTzvCZEUf

Annoyed or frustrated... Don't know how to feel... Any cute #morganders pics to cheer me up? :(

@elislin I'm catching up on you... ;)

@morganders4 @morgorybranders Don't know the exact name anymore, but it has all the old cases coming back...

@morganders4 Don't worry, I've got loads more #morganders fanfic ideas!

Just a quick one-shot... Don't worry, I'll continue #goingdutch as well! https://t.co/1bb6Gu3Rln #fanfic #csi #morganders #forgottenbirthday

Another @cutegirlhair hair day today: #CGHWaterDoubleFrench was perfect for a day of sports! http://t.co/MFzdzr9sB1

@CSIHiddenCrimes Do you know on which case we first see Morgan?

@morganders4 Being ignored should always get to you... No one should go without getting attention!

@morgorybranders Don't know which episode all photos are from immediately ( I know some)... Will have to rewatch S13! :D

@kdtaylor82 Do you know how to start? Just try one braid first: divide your hair in three equal pieces - a left, middle and right piece.

@CSIQuentasia @morganders4 Don't say that, I'm sure you did better than you think!!!

Last chapter, hope you guys'll enjoy! :) https://t.co/rfiArKDoIQ #csi #fanfic #morganders #anightinthewoods

@starlight1117 Thanks! :) Most luck will be for finding the time... Don't think my boss will let me write at work...

So: Russell was Doc's Secret Santa, Finn Russell's, Nick Finn's, who was Nick's Secret Santa? And...

@Cherielovers @noeasytologin Don't think so either... Although last year's Halloween ep was only shortly about it either. #morganders

RT @AnaLuisa_Guedes: @CSIWritersRoom @Leas_BiggestFan @ElisabethHarnoi Do not put more man in Morgan's life. Its only Greg, btw. Hodges is …

@CSIVegasQuotes @TVGuide "A person close to the CSI family..." Does that mean Ellie? And that Morgan will survive?

Amazing day: a day at the Dolfinarium, then a Freestyle Steps class and two episodes of #CSI tonight! #BestDayEver &lt;3

@GiorgiaCSI4ver @CSIWritersRoom Aw, poor Greg! He's been single for ages... Don't you want him to be happy? :D

RT @CSI_CBS: Nick, meet Sam the Dog. Vote for Best Chemistry on CBS Fan Awards and get #CSI in 1st place!: http://t.co/olZCQaOWm7 http://t.…

@CSIWritersRoom Hello! Do you know an address where I can send a letter to Elisabeth Harnois to?

@CSI_CBS Do you know an address where I can send a letter to Elisabeth Harnois to?

Today's #wakeupsong is... the third time I wake up with this in my head: Do it like that by Ricki Lee!

Today's #wakeupsong is Domino by Jessie J!

Today's #wakeupsong (can't believe I forgot so many days) is called Light it up. Don't know who sings it, but it's from #bodyvive!

Today's #wakeupsong (= the song stuck in my head when I wake up for who forgot! :)) is, again, Do it like that by Ricki Lee! What's yours?

Forgot this for a couple of days already: #wakeupsong of today is Do it like that by Ricki Lee!

Am actually amazed I can still walk after that workout this morning... Don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow of course! ;)
