@Isabeldeanda97 ah idk about Belgium we're just going to have to wait and see on Saturday when they play Argentina 🙆

@Isabeldeanda97 YES! USA shouldn't have even made it this far, but stuff happens I guess. I'm just going for Argentina now 💙🏆⚽️

@Isabeldeanda97 USA sucked tho 💆 we had more of a reason to be sad, mexico got cheated but I get ya 😌

@Isabeldeanda97 yeah except that Mexico should've won, but didn't because of a "penalty"

Is it weird that I prefer practice to be rn rather than later? 🎀💃
