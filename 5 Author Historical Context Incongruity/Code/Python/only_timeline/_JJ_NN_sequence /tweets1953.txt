@ClayOfficial he always made me do them like 30 minutes early lol

@ClayOfficial I never hear him say chief anymore, it's kinda disappointing

@ClayOfficial what? I didn't hear you

@ClayOfficial I want to just go ahead and tunnel out my bed but I don't have the money for that, If I did I would have 10 tens

@ClayOfficial I ordered a new ten

@ClayOfficial scratch that, give me $200

@ClayOfficial you got that foodway money though

@ClayOfficial you should give me $110 and let me pay you back Tuesday

@ClayOfficial you drive a small truck, you'll be fine

@ClayOfficial come see your best friend when you get off

@ClayOfficial well they can join the fan club

@ClayOfficial actually we're out here at the scaffs field lol

@ClayOfficial and probably will have to do the big 3 upgrade on your truck

@ClayOfficial that's not good lol, your amp definitely isn't getting the power it should. You'll have to upgrade for a 15 or 18

@ClayOfficial your power or your speaker wire?

@ClayOfficial he probably did for something that big, if you run something smaller it's like sucking a milkshake through a coffee stirrer

@ClayOfficial actually that's power wire lol, but speaker wire you'll want 8 gauge

@ClayOfficial led's cost barely anything and for speaker wire I would consider running new concept 0 gauge or 0/2 gauge

@ClayOfficial exactly, it slams though, you'll need alot of dynomat too or you'll hear more truck than bass

@ClayOfficial good luck with a budget, it's a competition 18 but it's worth your money

@ClayOfficial look at hifonics or crescendo

@ClayOfficial no clue how much he wants, he was on the fl basshead page trying to sell it, and I don't have anything powerful enough

@ClayOfficial buy dwain's RE 18, it needs 8 cubes of air though

@TheRealBHarr @ClayOfficial that's right,  I remember everyone that I didnt work with but I couldn't remember the guy that I worked with lol

@TheRealBHarr @ClayOfficial my friend was asking what his name was and I couldn't remember lol

@ClayOfficial what's the kids name thay drives the mini cooper?

@ClayOfficial nah, next week is my spring break

@ClayOfficial Kenneth is selling his system?

Off of work, time to break out this Evan Williams and relax

@ClayOfficial I got two new tens

@ClayOfficial its about time lol, yeah that song flexes my windshield so I say it hits pretty good

@ClayOfficial has he gotten any speakers yet?

@ClayOfficial I hear everyone at the high school is listening to that song now

@ClayOfficial alpine mrx-m55 550 watts rms, it should bang pretty hard

@ClayOfficial I also ordered a new amp btw

@ClayOfficial yeah, I have my RCA's running through it so it cuts off all connection to my amp

@ClayOfficial oh, if mine isn't on then I dont have music or bass

@ClayOfficial that's one thing that sucks about an eq, if that doesn't work, no boom

@ClayOfficial it hits midbass pretty good

@ClayOfficial you should download surface by aero chord

@ClayOfficial you got a fun bae then lol, that his Cammie is

@ClayOfficial she won't let you joke like that?

@ClayOfficial bae just says I'm sure you do when I tell her

@ClayOfficial tell her you have things to see and people to do tomorrow

@ClayOfficial that wouldn't surprise me

@ClayOfficial its a school night, go to bed

@ClayOfficial I'm about to be working at winn Dixie so I'll have a little money to play around with

@ClayOfficial you got a job, I'm about to get one then I'll get some alpines

@ClayOfficial  buy some new ones, I'm about to buy some new ones, these have almost had it

@ClayOfficial someone told me you have a big hole in one of your speakers

@ClayOfficial alpine 400 watt RMS mono block, its hard to breathe in my truck

@ClayOfficial you need to get this amp I have now

@ClayOfficial try bedrock in your truck, it beats

@ClayOfficial you should download white clouds by decaf and play it in your truck

@ClayOfficial I haven't heard it yet, I was just told about it, from everything I've heard, I'm the best so far

@ClayOfficial yeah the ones I have are only 270, the magnet on sundown are bigger than your head

@ClayOfficial theres someone here with a sundown 12, those take like 1000 watts a speaker to power

@ClayOfficial do you know what brand of sub it is?

@ClayOfficial the one from old Town?

@ClayOfficial Ive heard some stuff about it, I just bridged my speakers and I swear my dash is flexing

@ClayOfficial you're right, that guy with 4 15's in his Tahoe takes away the competition

@ClayOfficial I hear you got some bass competition at school

@ClayOfficial @DaltonL227 no one likes you clay

@ClayOfficial yep, all of it

@ClayOfficial im not helping Cindy, im doing 1-4 and that's all on the aisles

@ClayOfficial yeah, usually we have 300 come in on our trucks

@ClayOfficial 700 items to put up and my dad is on vacation

@ClayOfficial I was already working 7-5 and they didn't call him even though we have 700 units to put up

@ClayOfficial I would tell you to get to feeling better but we don't like you anymore

@ClayOfficial hungover?

@ClayOfficial why did you do this to us?

@ClayOfficial what size?

@ClayOfficial I don't know, just noticed it in the cold box

@ClayOfficial alright, I'll take care of it man

@ClayOfficial 10-4 I'll tell him when I go back in

@ClayOfficial don't forget to ask your dad about that box

@ClayOfficial nah, unless your mom's a man

@ClayOfficial cause im seeing things and doing people

@ClayOfficial you're right, I'm falling asleep

#ThingsPeopleDoThatPissMeOff breathe

@ClayOfficial I think you should go watch the conjuring

@ClayOfficial truuuu, lol

@ClayOfficial this person wants a piece of clay :P

@ClayOfficial i don't know how this is possible but congratulations on your baby.

@ClayOfficial I did, but I ran out of trick questions.

@ClayOfficial you've never played duck duck goose on fire?  Pretty intense

@ClayOfficial I'm glad you can subtract 11 and 5 and get six, you get a cookie

@AustinJGP @ClayOfficial at least answer that question before you get off

@ClayOfficial not him, the other one

@AustinJGP @ClayOfficial you know tomorrow is already today, right?

@ClayOfficial here's my opportunity again

@ClayOfficial he quit answering mine sooner than you did lol

@ClayOfficial i don't know if he knows it yet though

@ClayOfficial it still could have been trey, the beauty of anonymous questioning

@ClayOfficial can't prove it

@ClayOfficial @_Swaggered_Up obviously it's her, you blocked me and she's the only person left asking questions

@ClayOfficial can you tell who i'm trolling now?

@DaltonL227 @ClayOfficial a whole extra 5% off, what a deal!!!
