RT @TONYPALLO: are you ready for eric's illumination a short film by Tony Pallo

@TonyReale Ok, heavy black drapes around the perimeter? Stop light &amp; sound reflection?

@TonyReale http://t.co/bLZpDdLw The blankets will help stop reflections, an inexpensive &amp; non-permanent solution?

@TonyReale Hmmm... Right angles &amp; hard walls reflect too well. Perhaps a simple application of moving blankets held by C-stands behind cam?

@TonyReale Perhaps a dead space between the outer and studio walls? Connected via some dampened connectors? You'd lose a bit of studio space

@TonyReale embedded your video into my site as well. I agree 110% with you!

RT @TonyReale: Please RT! In this short video, I talk about a huge threat to filmmakers going on right now: http://t.co/1vCPCkT

@ZackFinfrock Great start on #NukaBreak! And the next webisode will be when...??? :)

@Hotcakes_Movie Just sayin' hello! How's hackin' treatin' ya?

@bluenile for IFN 48 Hour Recap. Some damn fine filmmakers here!

@hotcakes_movie Let's do you soon! Your movie that is... OK, you too ;)

@EricKessler Dude! You gotta try a Tito's Bloody Mary... smooth, tasty, and no headache afterward. And no crane needed... want, but not need

@ryan_connolly #filmriot Mayhaps the Battle LA poster be mine?  Used Cinestyle on T2i for the 48 this weekend. Not good. Need more practice!

RT @NextWaveDV: Why film is still king and digital has a long way to go to catch up  http://t.co/vcL4gSP

@Jag35 I'll be using the Field Runner, HD monitor and Monitor X for my T2I this weekend for the 48 Hour Film Project in New Orleans! Enjoy!

@stinger839 If I apply Magic Lantern on T2i, I can get ISO 160 & multiples thereof. May go that route. It's installed on SD card, not T2i.

@stinger839 OK, if you could shoot in any style on the T2i, what would it be and why?

@stinger839 Sorry, no jello shots to review. If you whip pan an HDSLR, you get the rolling shutter crap. Slow pans, no rolling shutter.

@stinger839 Just got home.. I'll look at MarvelCine and Technicolor Cinestyle a bit more closely. Taking your thoughts into account as well.

@stinger839 Great! Thanks!!

@triunefilms good on ya. Can't wait to see the TELL poster!

@ryan_connolly Gee! Me too!

@Hotcakes_Movie BTW, I'd like to do coffee or something tomorrow afternoon, if you're available, to touch base & get our game plan in order.

@Hotcakes_Movie If there's no picture, it didn't happen. BTW, you trying to look like the older FB pic with the two guys?

Check out @filmriot's latest episode! Funny sketch and Cowboys & Aliens effects: http://t.co/oxAipVy

@Hotcakes_Movie 200 minutes only, eh? Does that count texting as well? If not, save your minutes for drunk dialing ;)

@Hotcakes_Movie Sorry, I'll feel snubbed if I want to!!! ;)

@Hotcakes_Movie you always can try me!

@Hotcakes_Movie Hey, Jo.. what do ya know? Going to the mixer tonight? What's the word about tomorrow?

@Hotcakes_Movie New Madrid, MO... Close enough to IN, IL, TN, etc. to "cause a great disturbance in the force" 

@Hotcakes_Movie Sacramento to South Bend??? Is there an earthquake brewing I don't know about? Don't forget the New Madrid fault!

@Hotcakes_Movie eww... damn losers!

In terms of online backup, anyone have thoughts about @carbonite vs. MozyPro or any of the others?

@Hotcakes_Movie Who the heck is cyber-stalking you? Any clue?

@Hotcakes_Movie @J_LMartin Will do... You using your gmail account for this?

@ZackFinfrock Sad to see it end... but LOVED @ryan_connolly at the end! Waiting for your new show, ZacK!

@Hotcakes_Movie Can't wait to check out what your wooing has accomplished. Will I have to list you in the credits as "Official Woo-er"?

@Hotcakes_Movie @stinger839 Well, Hello Kelly!

http://yfrog.com/kia0hkfj @Jag35 the Monitor X is the shiznit!  Does that date me?

@ZackFinfrock Understood. Understood waaaaay too well! Have an adult beverage, chill, then get back on the horse!

My @DroboPro maybe quirky getting them setup, but are rock solid for file storage. Also looking for other archiving solutions. Thoughts?

@Hotcakes_Movie @J_LMartin sweeet... I'm going to crash... like my data did... We'll talk manana..

@J_LMartin @Hotcakes_Movie This weekend is actually bad for me. Let's plan on the 30th (next Saturday)? Jo, let's do coffee b4 then...

@Hotcakes_Movie what do you think about taking a Saturday before 48 and doing a test shoot to see how we all work together? Just thinking..

@Hotcakes_Movie the mouth on you!

@Hotcakes_Movie sure.. Craigslist for a Sound "Person". I wasn't trying to be sexist... HONEST!!! ;)

@Hotcakes_Movie you betcha

@Hotcakes_Movie I'll be working tomorrow, so I can give you a ride, if'n ya want..

@Hotcakes_Movie @J_LMartin It's tomorrow night @ 6-9PM The Big Top in NOLA. I'll be there, how 'bout y'all? Get a drink (or 2) & talk after?

@Hotcakes_Movie @richardbranson @kingisafink I'm throwing my hat in the ring on this one! 1st Space A.C.? Space Boom? Gaffer to the stars???

@Hotcakes_Movie Good on ya! Any idea what position? What exactly is your transpo issues and how will this affect the 48?

@Hotcakes_Movie ...that's stull better than stalking, right? It's all in how ya look at it... ;)

@TonyReale I've been a Premiere guy since before CS began. Running CS5.5 and totally loving it! Spread the love!

@Hotcakes_Movie I know, I know... I was exhausted, took a 5-hour energy drink, now I can't stop! Just ignore the ugly old dude...

@Hotcakes_Movie You win or lose? If you win, lemme front you some cash. If you lose, I'll buy you a drink.

@LaurieLeeV Dr's orders... Big glass of Pinot Noir or Pinot Grigio, soft jammies, a silly movie, then off to La-La land! You won't be sorry!

@Hotcakes_Movie My email? It's crap and "been there, done that", but can it be saved? I can take it. I'm a big boy who sews and cleans ;)

@jag35 I'm actually looking at that as a kit with the Field Runner (X Runner Bundle) Good gear, good workmanship, good price!

RT @EOSHD: Adobe are saying (currently off record) that Premiere Pro has surpassed Final Cut Pro's user-base, 2.3M versus 2M.

@Hotcakes_Movie I know... just letting the mind wander a bit! For good or bad! :)

@Hotcakes_Movie If you did... could be a good film in it! 

@Hotcakes_Movie Yeah, yeah, yeah... poke fun, why dontcha!

@zanelamprey Drinking a Turbodog at home...  THIS is badass!

@Volnado Yo! Some of your filmmakers with 24HRMV are Loyola alums! Go Wolfpack!

@TonyReale Errr... no. Keep away from the Skymall! :)

@cheesycam Thanks for the Merlin info! Get the good scoop at NAB!

@TonyReale Jealous!  Give us an in depth review when you get a chance.

@ZackFinfrock Come to the other LA, way down yonder, and I'll see what I can do! Is this for the big war flick?

@zanelamprey Phew! (I knew it... sorta...)  gotta cut back on the Turbodog.

Hanging @ the Filmmakers Meetup. Waiting to network. Not listening to the guest speaker!

@BobbyMiller Blade Runner over Brazil... but both are in the "Top Twenty"..

@TonyReale Just saw the specs. Dual XLR, Dual Record, 64GB internal, Infrared, manual control, small form factor, all for 2K.. pretty nice!

@TonyReale Why did you go with the XA10 vs. another cam or HDSLR?

@indymogul When will Q&Erik be on live? If you could choose one over the other, would you prefer using an HDSLR or a regular HD camcorder?

@ErikBeck Any "theme" this week for questions?

The video is done! Come and enjoy "Gots Ta Do" tonight at Maison on Frenchman @NesbyPhips @Volnado @24hrmv

@24hrmv What's the deal with the contest? Haven't heard any info one way or the other.

@denicphotos Isn't evenly lighting a cyc fun? Try it with chromakey!

@amykirk Micheal is a closet liberal! Sorry, but that's how I see him. He's a bit of a bully on the show!
