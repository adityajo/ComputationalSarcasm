@katykoos I never saw that one, I‚Äôll have to revisit it. I‚Äôm a sucker for a sad story in a comedy series, it has more impact somehow.

@katykoos Ah, now I preferred the radio version of Count. The TV version was ok but the radio one was more surreal, made it more funny

@katykoos I never watched it! I know, I‚Äôve missed out big time. Was it on Channel 4?

RT @ILoveGrimsby: My mum sent me a text with 'your' rather than 'you're' in it and now she will never see her grandchildren.

@lynn_gin_d Very true ;)

RT @sunny_hundal: This VIZ mag parody of tabloids and their attacks on benefits 'scroungers' is timeless http://t.co/YwGkBeACWP

@lynn_gin_d They love a good, sensationalist story and don't care about who they upset to get it. British tabloid journalism sucks.

‚ÄúWatch Over You‚Äù by @alterbridge is my new jam. Listen: http://t.co/dJyX17KIJQ

@darrenhoskins Shhh! They'll hear you :) I know what you mean though, I'm a surprised as you are.

@darrenhoskins Approved! I've used the app for years, nothing comes close to it.

@lynn_gin_d Ahh then all the more reason to cross everything. Good luck hun x

@lynn_gin_d For whatever reason, all appendages crossed for ya x

@CharlyHops Atta girl! Some other mug will have to do it next time :)

@CharlyHops Book it wrong, they won‚Äôt ask you to do it again. #ManLogic

@darrenhoskins Well played, there is nothing wrong with this meal choice!

Congrats to @alterbridge on entering at number 6 in the official album chart this week!

@darrenhoskins Agreed, apart from that it's not a bad film

@darrenhoskins Get ready for lens flare overload, it's chocka!

@CharlyHops Perfect, I love fangs. Foam bananas too please x

@Egregiousness Are you in my town? It's identical. Bloody animals. *huffs and puffs*

@CharlyHops Well, just bring yourself then. I have just discovered an assorted bag of chocolatey things so we're good.

@CharlyHops Best not to shine a black light over it eh *cheeky winky face*

@CharlyHops *pffft* "Pancake batter" yeh, whatever

For those who want to know how my head works, please see this example from the wonderful @tweetbarkdonkey http://t.co/RAITpQqX8b

@darrenhoskins *applause* Very good :)

@Pols80 Haha! Christ, is it sad I know what you mean? #HollyLaughingAtMeatInnuendo

@Pols80 Screw tv, everything we need is online. *fires up YouTube for videos of dogs with their heads hanging out of car windows*

@darrenhoskins @Egregiousness Same here. I'd walk out and end up eating hot cheese covered tortillas in a cinema thoroughly enjoying myself!

@Pols80 Ah sod it, budge up.

@Egregiousness @darrenhoskins It sounds horrific to be fair...

@Pols80 I'm fighting the urge to go up myself. I'm will not be defeated! I don't care if I have to watch a loop of hilarious cats all night.

@ProstitutePanda I will bring him, trussed up, direct to your door x

@DougStanhope talking about his mothers suicide on "Beer Hall Putsch" is piss-drainingly funny! What? Don't judge me...

@ProstitutePanda I'm comfortable enough to admit when another man is handsome and he is. You would make a good couple ;)

@Pols80 If it wasn't for other people, outside would be awesome!

@Pols80 It's like they expect EVERYONE to outside, drinking and doing Colombian marching powder off someone's back. Not that I would be...

@ProstitutePanda All yours hun, you can have nice rugged babies together :)

@ProstitutePanda I reckon I stand more of a chance with him ;)

@Pols80 Yeh but I have no Supernoodles *kicks cat* hang on, I don't have a cat...

@ProstitutePanda I normally would, Kevin has a mesmeric hold over me at times...

@Pols80 Mmm very nice, I have sour cream and chive pretzels to keep me going. I may have a Pot Noodle soon. #WondersWhyHesSingle

@Pols80 Is that the pirate radio thing? I lasted half an hour before self harming.

@Pols80 *prays to the Twitter gods*

@Pols80 Stop toying with my dreams! I'd love to be paid for this nonsense :D

@Pols80 We would be INVINCIBLE! Screw you Facebook, we're taking over *flicks Vs to Zuckerberg*

@Pols80 It actually is better than everything else in the world! this can solve ALL world problems!!

@Pols80 On the rocks with a splash of Cherry Coke. It's just like pop.

@Pols80 I've had 3 Di Saronnos so far, im on my fouth. This is dangerous stuff :D

@Pols80 At least you're wearing pyjamas... *coughs*

@Pantone19_2045 I've had a lovely day so far, just had a nice glass of Di Saronno and now feeling lovely and warm :)

@CharlyHops Did last night break you? It must have. *passes pillow*

@CharlyHops I have alcohol and bacon if that makes things any better?

@CharlyHops Damn, you got it bad :(

@Egregiousness Ahh that‚Äôs why I love 6 Music :)

@Egregiousness Haha why the hell are they playing this? *whistles along*

@Pantone19_2045 I'll go chop some wood now, the kettle will be whistling when you get here :)

@Pantone19_2045 Today has nothing in store for me apart from a Tesco delivery, a lot of film watching and plenty of hot drinks and snacks x

@Pantone19_2045 Bag left in hun, just as you like it. Glad to see you're a fellow Guardian reader too :)

@CharlyHops You're welcome! *runs off into the night*

@CharlyHops How do you know you haven't? Eh? Yehhhhhh!

@CharlyHops There's not much in it for you, literally. It's over before you know and you're just left confused. Shexy.

@missprofanity Night mum x

@CharlyHops Ah but have you experienced it? It's a unique skill.

@CharlyHops Already have x

@Capt_Bucktard Haha not been called that since Mrs Jones said it after school once...hang on.

@CharlyHops It's in the "bank" ;)

@CharlyHops Some men would pay good money for that. I, however, have a good imagination and I'm cheap.

@CharlyHops I imagined a thigh slap when you said that ;)

@CharlyHops Greedy bitch x

@CharlyHops Don‚Äôt eat Twitter. I‚Äôll have nothing to do this weekend :/

@Capt_Bucktard That‚Äôs pretty fucking epic hun, well played!

@Pantone19_2045 @Pols80 Shaven headed men, my gift to you both!

@Yippieeeeee @ThePsyentistUK Please don't let those fuckers win, it's a nice face. Have a drink and cause some bother.

@ThePsyentistUK @Yippieeeeee That's the one. It's dogshit. Recently used on an accident lawyers advert, says it all. *kicks telly*

@Yippieeeeee That one from Chumbawumba. When sober, it makes me want to kill.

@ShelleyWhitmore Know any good places for pie and mash with a bit of liquor? I've never tried it but it's on my list ;)

@ShelleyWhitmore Sounds good me hun, I'll take you up on that :)

@ShelleyWhitmore Not done the tour yet but will do at some point, it looks ace! Let me know about the book, he mentioned it briefly x

@ShelleyWhitmore I won't spoil it for you in case you want to see him or read his books but his theories make sense, you should enjoy it x

@ShelleyWhitmore :) Cheers! It was a very good night, he came up with some good new theories and dispels a lot of myths. V interesting!

@Pantone19_2045 That's loaded with innuendo, just how I like it!

@Pantone19_2045 That's been favourited! I'm also gonna print it off and carry it round with me :D

@CharlyHops I'd commit a fairly major misdemeanour for a filthy McMuffin right now.

@Pantone19_2045 Perfect, cheers hun. I haven't got any coffee so will this do!? http://t.co/fmMpNR0fLM

@Pols80 Breakfast is served! (Stealth delete of untagged tweet) http://t.co/JcTS9GFXN5

Jack the Ripper: A 21st Century Investigation with Trevor Marriott (at @VenueCymru) http://t.co/Pt2TLiyawA

@CharlyHops I'm a sucker for sausage and mash with gravy, best meal ever! Right, that's going on the shopping list for the weekend :)

@CharlyHops I would've got you one if I'd known. You would also have no need to eat for a week after it...

@CharlyHops Steak &amp; cheese with gherkins, tomatoes, green peppers and black olives with honey mustard on herb &amp; cheese bread. I'm done in.

I'm at @SUBWAYUkireland (Ewole, Flintshire) http://t.co/67r3Su81QV

@gandhipants Do you have booze?

@Pantone19_2045 Are you married? I don't care, I'm stealing you away from him if you are.

@Egregiousness I'd left school by then :(  #FeelingEvenOlderNow

@Pantone19_2045 Get me some meringues and some custard please x

@ShelleyWhitmore Im fascinated by it. Going to see this guy tonight, an ex police guy http://t.co/3KCA1zIXZq I'll let you know what he says!

@Pols80 You forgot "There's lovely for you!" at the end... ;)

@Pols80 At a push yeh. I do a very poor female voice impression but my gruffness can be put down to "illness".

@Pols80 For you my dear, anything x

@ShelleyWhitmore Stuck in work until 4 so not too bad. Heading of to see a guy talking about Jack the Ripper tonight, looking forward to it!

@ShelleyWhitmore The detox went rather well :) How's you today hun?

@Pantone19_2045 Haha! I like your reasoning there ;)

@Pantone19_2045 @Pols80 That'll be the 24 meringue nests you ate yesterday... ;)

@Pols80 I'm used to that. You can wear one of my shirts while I make you a coffee

@Pols80 You'll need a cigarette and a shower after seeing it...

@Pols80 There will be a filthy tea for tonight so I hope that tips things in my favour!

No cheap sandwich for me! 2 dirty warm sausage rolls from @GreggstheBakers will do me fine! #pig

@Pols80 "Damn right that they can smell talc.
