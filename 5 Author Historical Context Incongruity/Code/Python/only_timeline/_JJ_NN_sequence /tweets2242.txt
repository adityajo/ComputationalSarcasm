"A Flexible Spine Is A Healthy Spine" So Says Core Fitness System! Protect Your Spine and Back While Working Out! #CoreFitness #Lumbar

Fitness equipment should accommodate the body in a correct way to protect and support the spine, while isolating the muscle(s) being worked.

Perfect posture should be maintained during all isokinetic exercises. #GoodPosture #Workout #StrengthTraining #SportsMedicine #Fitness

Core Fitness System believes the majority of exercise programs &amp; fitness equip today are flawed; will eventually cause injuries long term.

Our "Work Up To Free Weights-Cardio Workout" is superior, safer and more effective compared to other workouts that don't protect the spine.
