Jake has a job PAing for American Idol... And he wants me to try out.

RT @kissthecosmos: Anytime I hear or see something about "McDonalds" 😷😷😷😷😷

RT @AbbyLynn_14: And I'm gonna love without fear because its a beautiful thing.

Everyone wonders why I spend so much time with him... Because he's the only person who isn't a bitch to me. Ever.

I just wanna go home.

LOLOLOLOLOLOL I fucking hate this job

I just cried so hard  https://t.co/hf7n0dAowc

I can't be on social media when someone dies. I understand the hurt, but death is a part of life. It should be celebrated instead of mourned

Gee I'm kinda hurt. The one Fathers Day I get to spend with dad and when I'm told someone will call me I'm left the whole day waiting.

@samanthaleigh_8 stfu I'm taking a week off to watch you give birth 😒

Hi. I live somewhere cool. 🌲🗻 http://t.co/i5B00RzvlY

I can't wait for Jake to come home

RT @kehlanimusic: I can't wait to see my future husband glow on Father's Day.

...... Yeah take me back to the camp site where I had no service for 3 days.

@Galvez_Brittany I know. I promise to visit you guys soon.

@Galvez_Brittany I miss y'all 😕

It sucks that @Galvez_Brittany and the girls are all in Colorado less than an hour away from me and I can't see them 😭💔

@xoxo_celestee OH yeah I'm talking about you 😜

@xoxo_celestee lol why do I need to chill?

If I get no service this weekend and can't talk to Jake I'm going to flip shit.

RT @itsGirICode: "Hey what's up?"

Idk I'm at work.

I was at work.

I will be highly upset if I don't get a good tan this weekend

WHY IS EVERYONE BEING A DOUCHEBAG

Look, I prob would go Lesbian for Ruby Rose but I'm WAY too straight for that shit 😂 she's just a sexy woman, ain't no harm in thinkin that💁

Just wait till I spend money on her 😏

Thanks mom, for telling me what I need to do and getting my ass back in gear. 💕

I don't understand how I worry about nothing but me, and I still do everything wrong..

"If someone would have told me 8 years ago that I'd be lying in bed next you you, I woulda said they were crazy."

I am so over G.O.T. 😭 what is this show doing to my heart

It's already been a month for Jake and I? 😳 gee time is sure flying by lol

Be with someone who makes you laugh uncontrollably and constantly. It's so much fun, and I'm so happy all the time 💕

K why are you gonna like a picture of my ex and I a year ago? Like no. The past is the past. Let's leave it there.

I just wanna sleep 😞

If you're in Texas wanting to move here in Colorado... Please don't. Stay there. I like my place the way it is. Unless you're actually nice.

Reason 5394819737928 why I need to quit my job: they were willing to leave me in the kitchen for an hour by myself.

So I'm now not allowed to touch my own door when I am around Jake. He opens them for me.

Soooo @chancetherapper @SuperDuperKyle Jeremih, and Big Sean all did a song together.... Yeah I know what I'll have on repeat for a while

Dude I cant tell you how awesome it is to be able to see my best friend whenever I want and go to concerts with her n shit 💛 @xoxo_celestee

I don't see a "rod".

It's coloRADo......assholes.

Whatever though, that's why I'm leaving. 💁

Tell me I'm head of a dept for a week, but don't tell me what I'm supposed to do, and expect me not to fail? K thanks douche.

Lmao y'all thought 😎 are u kidding I'd never cut it 😍 http://t.co/QU8P14DzK2

Guys look what I did... http://t.co/FW3ffOv6oe

Please don't ever go back to someone who's cheated on you or has ever disrespected you. It's not worth it.

I know this lifetime is it because I know more than I should and despise being a part of this world. I want to be home, wherever it is.

My personal life gets better and my job gets worse. I swear I need out.

RT @MODSUN: the way I think will allow me to succeed. the way I see myself is the person I'll be remembered for.

As of today I've been graduated a full 365 days. What. The. Fuck.

But I thought he'd be gone another day sooooo I made plans 😀

I've had a shitty work day and my head hurts. I went shopping, and now I want to cuddle... Jake y u do dis

All I did after graduation was smoke a bowl with @samanthaleigh_8 and talk about those last 4 years. Fuck an after party. 😂

I'm getting a white wolf-like dog and naming him Ghost

And I have to work 8 straight days. 😤

Jakes gone until Sunday and I'm like 😐

I FUCKING HATE MY JOB

I miss @samanthaleigh_8 way too much.

I'm so fucking happy 😍💛

RT @samanthaleigh_8: I'm already going to have been graduated for a year. Crazy how many things have changed since then.

"I get to point at you and say, 'See that beautiful girl? She's my girlfriend.'"

Jake has me building my own light saber... I'm not even a huge Star Wars fan but this is cool af

I hate being at work. Like... Nothing about it is enjoyable anymore.

I keep bragging because y'all don't know how good it feels to be treated so greatly after being treated like shit for so long.

I fell asleep on Jake last night when we were watching tv with everyone, and he carried me all the way to bed instead of waking me up. 💘

It's always just with me too. 😂

My mans ex will always want him back when I'm with him. No bish... Mine. Fucking mine.

Ew I hate feeling all introverted and to myself.

Happy Birthday to my best friend, and as each day passes I realize I haven't known you for the last 8… https://t.co/FaQnl4cktD

I'm like nah hamie I got everyone else's babies to spoil 😍

@karebear200525 but I love it cuz your pwetty 😁

RT @MODSUN: alive movie https://t.co/6lpYWIHSTq

Idk if it was Jake, or the motivation I've been having, but I have this little light in my eyes now. Everything feels and looks better.

Some days Jake and I will just sit in his half empty apartment, drink a few, and watch Soul Eater and I love it

I love Quinn. She smoked with me that one time.

And I'm leaving 😞

My mom came home and hugged me for no reason and I just really love that woman

Wondering what to get Jake for his birthday isn't my problem, it's choosing from the 500 choices I have.

It's been 4 yrs since I started following Eazy's music. It's pumped me up, made me cry, given me comfort. Swear, his ear for music is talent

It pisses me off when the guys I liked start wanting to talk to me AFTER I have a boyfriend. Like nah you missed that chance. ☝️

Lmao I love Savannah

RT @danielllelujan: The relationship I have with my father &gt;

I can't explain how much love I feel from one person. I've never felt so appreciated and genuinely cared for.

I hate being in the kitchen. Fucking come make your own food. Ya fatasses.

I hardly get truly angry or pissed off.

I don't understand how I get so frustrated so easily but I will never get angry.

Probably why I have such a hard time with self love.

This happens to me way too much and I'm not sure why.

I'm so tired of this weather 😞

Got It Like That (Eleven:11 Remix) shouts to bro @PELLYEAH 

Jake would be filming the two days I have off. 😑

WHEN THE FUCK IS CERSEI GOING TO DIE

I've never played bass before.

Fuck yeauhh  https://t.co/2B70nZGIxC

It's a good opportunity, but I wanna do other things with my life.

Way more money, but I will still hate my job.

Last time I dressed up like this was when bae took me on my first date ever

I love how even if I see my mom for 15 min, we DO NOT stop talking..like its a full on convo until she walks out the door. 💛

Theresa is always trying to bitch at me, so I bitch at her back and she just ends up laughing.

RT @jerricafaith: LMAO LITERALLY SOMETHING GOES WRONG EVERYTIME I START TALKING TO SOMEONE NEW THE WORLD DOES NOT WANT ME TO MOVE ON

RT @cle_ohhhh: It's important to make someone happy and it's more important to start with yourself.

I'm feelin' good. She lookin' fine.

I'm feelin brand new. Just bought some brand new.

With all the crazy goin on here, I miss the Tx weather.

This isn't a one day thing. I don't especially give credit to my mother this one day. Every single… https://t.co/s5vyv3Ci71

I don't think I could love my mother anymore than I do now. She's my hero.

Is that big yellow thing in the sky the sun?! 

Oh god I miss you...

Tbh, driving in the snow actually soothes me. I'm too focused on driving safely to think about my life problems.

Ima get you like, faded. I want ya, faded, when I call ya.

I'm feelin good, he lookin fine. I know the truth ain't gonna matter tonight.

I mean if I could have you now I would.

@crocs_and_jorts I would so do it. 😂

Idk bout y'all but I cannot talk about my sex life on social media. Like no.

I demand trial by combat..

Thank you, I love the real you too. 💛 https://t.co/2mlQa7eb60

I even got my tires rotated for free 😏

Happy Birthday to my best friend, sister by heart, and cousin. I love you forever. 💕🎉 https://t.co/jdtO3cDNxF

RT @kehlanimusic: dear god. if I am wrong. right me. if I am lost. guide me. if I start to give up, keep me going. lead me in light and lov…

I can't do this job anymore.

I can't do this. I can't run a good shift like this not with your tense energy around me.

RT @irreIevent: stay away from ppl who make u feel like ur hard to love

Can I just sing for the rest of my life? That'd be cool

😭😭😭 I can't see @SuperDuperKyle tonight omg I'm never forgiving myself for this 💔

Just tired of being told and shown I'm worth nothing. It hits me on nights like these. I really feel like it, even though I know otherwise.

I'm a little achey tonight. My heart kinda hurts and I feel sad. But I know I'm getting somewhere..

Joffrey FINALLY died 😒

Every time I watch the girls put on the fiber mascara I'm just like "I don't get it, that's my lashes with regular mascara.."

Like all I wanna do is change the world and I can't do that until I change myself.

I hope you reach this state of mind. It's liberating and at the same time it's the toughest thing in my life I've had to go through.

I'm even off tomorrow and I still can't see @SuperDuperKyle cuz no date

I'm in such a funk

Rain is good for the soul, funny how I feel the most warm when it's cold.

Omfg my heart he's so sexy 😍 @xoxo_celestee  https://t.co/MnPsnIt2sr

Forever down, I am your lady. Always for sure, never a maybe.

RT @cle_ohhhh: I pretend a lot of shit doesn't get to me

RT @cle_ohhhh: Do I want you?

Will I chase you?

I miss you so much. I hate feeling like you're here and knowing you aren't.

This thing we got is crazy, all I know is your my baby.

I've had 3 people tell me I have a pretty smile today

Like damn am I her only parent?

It really pisses me off when I can't even drink a few glasses without worrying about my sister.

I try not to venture there.

I love it  https://t.co/xwx8oMtlyl

I have no idea what time I'm working tomorrow..

@samanthaleigh_8 I'm trying. 😫

@samanthaleigh_8 I'm using the same face as in the picture and everything

I miss u @samanthaleigh_8 http://t.co/S6Gw4dNY0j

There's not much difference but I was so happy with myself at that point

Uhhh why don't I look like this anymore 😭💔💔 http://t.co/UcbHbLdgV3

RT @ImmortalTech: I wonder what that conversation was like. "Hey I found a random picture to scare the shit outta people, lets try it!" htt…

If you have the nerve to make someone feel stupid or lame for posting something sentimental then you're a dumbass.

This episode went from superduper happy to superduper I'm gonna kill myself cuz this is so sad

I have no one to go see @SuperDuperKyle next week with. 😭

I need more friends.

One day I'll be waking up to flowers in my room all da time 💐

It was weird

So I was talking to my mom about what dabs were.

However, my cramps are overbearingly painful right now. So excuse me while I go home and smoke a bowl to le face.

It was awesome watching my sister run her relay. She smoked 'em!

I promise to sing to the love of my life every chance I can get... So long as they  enjoy it. 💘

@VincentTorres47 I'm getting there I definitely got my ass in gear the last few days, I don't see myself stopping any time soon 😋

RT @kenlewlew: i want what I deserve

Well... I cleaned the whole house and did my laundry... I paid my car payment, got a new bed set... Now what?😅

Swear I can never have a normal phone call with Christian. It always cuts out 😫

But I'm too savage for these fuckboys

Tonight's one of those nights I'd love to go on a date.

Better be meeting my twin flame if I'm goin through this shit

I hope everyone was fortunate enough to have a good day. 😄

I mean.. I for one know I'm not a piece of shit.

Cause I don't want to be saved. I can do that, I just want someone to be there.

I'm not gonna save you. You have to save yourself. It's part of the journey, but I'll fight to be there for you if you let me.

If you assume you're nothing to me then eventually it's gonna happen.

RT @Silvas_IV: Just have to keep staying positive.

Can you chill? I ain't tryna hear this today.

@VincentTorres47 lmao I know. Thanks, Vince ☺️

I can't even focus at work right..

I'm so uneasy now. And so afraid.

@VincentTorres47 someone was sitting in my moms car smoking and drinking when I left for work and I chased him off

But I'm lucky he didn't have a gun

But I don't care at that moment. There was a threat and I did what I could to make it go away.

There's a very good possibility I could have gotten killed just now.

I still can't believe Daenerys has dragons

I'm not asking to be someone's everything, cause that never works out. I just wanna be someone's something.

I'm so done asking people to hang.

Why am I so interested in you? 😐

RT @Charrni: I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy.

@SapientSpirit you didn't offend me. I love both of you. However, certain things should be kept between you two and you two only.

God I'm so fucking glad I left. 😒

@samanthaleigh_8 @SapientSpirit @BlaydenVibes Knock it off. Where the fuck is this going? If you're that pissed quit talking 2 each other

I just want someone to spend the night with me when they can cuz cuddles... And... Uh... More cuddles

@samanthaleigh_8 just needs to move up here so I can be baby daddy

I think everyone should shut the fuck up

I. Do not. Care. Anymore.

everyone is just SO anal about EVERYTHING. Chill! Let it be. Mind your own and things will be alright, man.

I know plenty of people who've had babies young and if anything it saved their lives.

Like people need to chill with all that. PEOPLE HAVE BABIES ITS NATURE

Having a kid at a young age isn't a new thing. It's not bad either. Shit happens.

I always think bad things about people, but I think and decide to keep it to myself cause maybe they're hurting to.

I pay my bills and give everyone a smile even if it hurts.

I may not be going to school YET but hey at least I have my shit together.

Oh I'm sorry, I thought we were out of high school. 💁🏽

Don't you dare disrespect a friend of mine. I love EVERYONE regardless of the shit they do.

I can't even consider it if you don't open doors for me 💁🏽

I still have 5 hours here 😭

Just.... stay the night with me so I have someone to cuddle

I had a good day 😌

Uh I think everyone should just get over themselves.

Well I'm just glad someone understands what I want right now lol

I don't give a shit of smoking is unattractive to you. I probably wasn't trying to get your attention anyway

MY HAIR FEELS SO SHORT

I was gonna go sleep but apparently people love me now and wanna come over 😂

RT @_olivver: It's more to feed your mind.

Then it disappears and I wonder why I was even angry in the first place.

I honestly don't believe I take my anger out on people. I bottle it in and just keep it there.

RT @llcoolshae: my tweets will have you thinking im single, taken, happy, sad, alone all that stuff 😂 I just be tweeting so don't come look…

Like. Just the job. I love my coworkers I just really hate my job 😂

I need a new job.

I can't wait for the end of the year.

It's crazy connecting with someone, and never losing that regardless of how far you are. That's true love and friendship.

I promise, it means that much to me.

I wouldn't wait for just anyone.

@TGOD__16 @thatdudecolten take some more for me cause I won't be there.

I'm not sure if it's the change in my attitude or people, but it feels so good to feel good ✨

I've been hearing nothing but wonderful and encouraging things from people lately.

Like of course she can use it but like... I'd like to have a life too

I'm off for 3 days and can't do shit cause my mom is using my car from 2-10 to go to work.

So now I'm sad

Safe to say though I can't fucking wait for Global 😍

First time running the shift and I'm not doing too bad.

I remember that when I get in a bad mood because those are compliments from total strangers ☺️

I'm. So exhausted.

I love all the kandi I got too

I met so many beautiful people last night. 💕

My goal every concert: Get there looking great and leave looking fucked up. That's how I know I had fun

SO EXCITED FOR GLO TONIGHT

This isn't your shift so step the fuck down. I'm not gonna be the one afraid to say something to you when it comes down to it

I don't know how no one sees through all her bullshit. Like why are you not fired?

If Lorena is gonna stay here I'm not gonna deal with this shit.

WHY DO PPL KEEP TELLING ME  I'M PRETTY WUT KINDA APRIL FOOLS JOKE IS THIS

When I'm doing good, it's not good enough. I'm so tired of life rn lol I wanna go home and hide in my room for a week.

@justtRobbb LMFAO 😂 I'm always so scared to fuck that up when I type too 😂

I don't really get mad I just get so flustered i shirt everything out

Yesterday I was told I was pretty twice by two different strangers. Today someone told me I was awesome for being so nice and smiley.

I hate missing you. Cause wow would you have loved it here

That was like the longest message I've ever sent. 😂

My mood got fucked sideways real fast, but I'm gonna try to get back to my happy self lol

No matter how hard I try it's never going to be enough for you.

I'm just in a shitty mood today I don't like it..

The things or people I love make me feel something, that's why I love them.

It pisses me off when people take things too seriously. Please just go with things with me.

I love how Lorena will tell me to do shit, just to piss me off and Evan is like "GO ON BREAK ILL DO IT! Why are you even still here go home"

I miss the hell outta them

If your significant other is your whole life you need to rethink. Be your own person whilst growing with them.

Well whatever I didn't wanna see you anyway ✋😒

Nvmd I'm just a mess 😂

Lmao I'm such a hot mess

@Outgageous I mean why not? Once I have money. 😂

@Outgageous I'll fly yall here

Happy Birthday babes! I miss and love you mucho! 😍🎉💕 @OshinCarr

RT @celestial_gomez: I used to have my phone with me ALL of the time. 

Now I don't know where it is half the time. 😅

I miss @OshinCarr like way too much

I hope y'alls Senior Ditch Day was as cool as mine last year. 😎

I think I'm gonna marry him.

And I'm such a loving person like... I love everyone so for me to not like you you'd have to do a lot.

I just wanna punch you in the fucking face. Why are you still here? All you do is fuck things up and make people miserable. 😒

I'm in absolutely no rush, but I hope whoever is coming, comes soon. I feel it and it's so much for me to even take in.

@VincentTorres47 I'm gonna live in Denver for a few years to do just that. 😊

RT @StimuIating: Her: If you can drink that in under 3 seconds I'll let you hit it.

RT @WorIdStarVidz: I'll just leave this here http://t.co/mLF5XY1Dac

Oh boy I'm just having the most lovely day ever 😍

Kevin: "You're always so happy. It makes me happy when I see you in the mornings!"

RT @jordylopez22: Is it Friday yet?

One of my regular customers have me hand warmers because my hands are always icy. I love people 💕

In middle school I always had conditioning with the boys. Every time we played dodgeball I'd get it to the face. EVERY. TIME. 😂

Lmao yeah sorry I might be in Cali by next year 😂

It's so cute and random lol

.... I have a freckle on my toe

I am SO excited for the things coming my way.

Not sure why it's you I keep missing.

@ZackAEspinoza I'm barely starting my collection. I have G-Eazy, Echosmith, and SWS Lets Cheers to This

Sometimes I really miss it..

I had a dream about Brandon last night and his dad and everyone was in it and it made me miss them lol

If my ex is anonymous messaging me on tumblr I'm fr gonna be creeped tf out

It's ridiculous how much @G_Eazy is on my phone

Lol... It's raining good enough

RT @alexandria_lara: Shave.. goosebumps.. cry.. repeat. #TheStruggleIsREAL

It's such a beautiful day here in Colorado 😍 Sunshine for MILES ☀️💛

Happy #InternationalWomensDay! 💁😌

I like us better when we're wasted 😉

RT @samanthaleigh_8: I just want to be with @valeenalives &amp; @SapientSpirit... I miss you guys terribly 😭💔💔

RT @MODSUN: I'm here but I'm really gone

I won't let anyone love me unless you love me like Rory loves Amy 😭😭😭

Most common nickname I have: 

RT @bIankpoetry: the only decent thing that came out of that dress explosion on the internet are these two photos http://t.co/JjMVOwJaIY

I still have plenty of money after making my car payment. 🙏

I swear I had the most wonderful dream last night and I can't stop replaying it in my head 😍😍

I said camping and lakes too right?

I can't wait for summer; Lake days, camping trips, trips up the mountains for no reason, more mountains. 😍

If I destroy you, I destroy myself. If I honor you, I honor myself. 🙏

If you ever have a really swollen, sore throat.. Do yourself a favor and gargle a glass of hot water with a tbsp of salt. Works great!!

RT @girlposts: THIS IS SO IMPORTANT https://t.co/caoyEdDjwv

He's like one of the few people who still calls to just make me laugh or see how I'm doing ☺️

RT @MODSUN: I love the sun so much I wish I could stare at it.

Yeah I love it

I just saw a commercial for weed

Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist is probably one of my favorite movies

I intend on keeping it like that. I show people what I want them to see. If you wanna know the real me you gotta work towards it

Like lol no I just learn the hard way. I'm an old soul, I know much more than I should. I stay humble though.

Especially since I have no idea what's wrong with me

I wish my mom was home. It's one thing to be sick and miserable but it's another to be sick miserable AND alone😕

Least if you come then I'll be less alone, I wanna run away with you.

And as bad as she is, she can't be basic or at least I can't imagine she is.

Run away with me, I swear I got us

I've never been this sick before, please go away 😭

I can't handle being sick I just sit in bed and cry it out 😂

The weathers got my allergies fucked up I feel awful

You don't give two shits if I miss you. 😒

Doesn't help I feel sick. I don't even wanna be around food much less making it 😒

Which I'm exited about bc my weight isn't my problem it's the way I look and I don't think I've ever looked or felt this good 😊

I've gained muscle weight 😁

Really annoying how I can't stop thinking about it..

"We can dance to any song, or every song, or no song. I don't care!" ☺️

“@SapientSpirit: Why can't I retweet @valeenalives! Gah that girl is on point.” Because I know more than I should 😅

Like that's what I live for, to help people understand things about themselves they can't yet.

Some of my closest friends don't understand that I'm here for them &amp; it bothers me I'm not someone they go to for help.

RT @kt_castillo12: I could be broke but have a million dollar smile. 😉

Jk I don't give a shit

I wonder how you feel now that you can't creep my tweets 😉

I have a whack ass schedule this week lmao

I'd like to not see you lmao

When you stressed out and you need somethin, I got you.

If I miss the sound of anyone's voice, it's yours.

It's an internal journey only yourself can take. It's the road to knowing a better you, and when that happens, you spark growth in others.

If you've seen Aquamarine, all I want is someone to dance with me the way Raymond dances with Aqua 😭😭

Mmmm I smell like vanilla. 😍

I feel shitty I wanna do something but I also know I'm probably not doing anything today so I'm just here lmao

My new hoodie is so sick 😈 and its PINK too 😍

RT @SapientSpirit: I seriously hope and wish valeena comes down here for spring break! I loved the beach with her last year! 😎🌴🌊 @valeenali…

There's just no motivation... I'm tired of feeling like that.

I need to get my shit together.

That's all I'm worried about ☝️

RT @wicvh: he said he lovesss me cus I'm .....

Like nah I'll just sit in my room and chill, thanks.

RT @xo_sluna: I'm such a nice person but do not piss me off

I just wanna see you dance in slow motion

I spoiled myself today and it felt so good 😭

I just think it's cool how mothers know so much about their children even before they're born.

When my mom was pregnant she wrote about how she knew I was gonna be a bubbly person.

@BigMikeinator I've been listening to Planes by Jeremih and J Cole 😁

It's cool listening to Eazy and getting to be like "yeah I saw that live.... Three times" 😌😏

Happy I got to see my papa today especially after the day I've had.

STOP BEING LAZY OR GO TO FUCKING BURGER KING GOD DAMN

Man I can't wait to get today over with like fuck this

I love my freckles 💗

Lmao my uncle just gave me a nug. I'm wit it 💁

Dropped 4 lbs in 2 weeks Yeauhhhhhh I'm happy

@VincentTorres47 it very possibly could, and trust me I cried it was just weird as hell 😂 Thanks, Vincent 😊

@Viktoryahhh oh no believe me I cried! Lol but thank you ☺️ I completely agree.

RT @Viktoryahhh: “@valeenalives: But I wanna cry..? Wtf” if you want to cry, then cry. "Pain demands to be felt." Sometimes crying isn't a …

But I wanna cry..? Wtf

But I have no reason to be sad so...? 

Like I'm happy.

I honestly feel so sad right now. Like I wanna cry..

Majority of my friends snap stories, I can tell they're just as baked as I am.

I'm just always too hopeful. People hold places in my heart long after I know they're gone.

I loooooove all the snow 💕 my first winter back home feels so amazing

RT @DeveanIsack: 100% truth "@valeenalives: If we aren't musically compatible then we aren't compatible at all"

If we aren't musically compatible then we aren't compatible at all

I wish some people could just fuck off sometimes.

RT @Outgageous: In need of a new job

I love @CamMeekins because he makes a song like Amber. Good vibes flowin.

God I miss you so much..

Truth is I'm probably not thinking at all. I let my soul talk to me and what it wants, I give to it.

Don't tell me what's going through my head or what you THINK you know.

Bugs the hell out of me when someone believes they know the person I am, when they hadn't even scratched the surface.

I mean I can't even go 40 without my car slipping 😐

Lmao I'm not driving and risking my life for my mcdonalds job today. I tried and came home 😂

I'm doing amazing where I'm at right now. 💕

Whyyy do you think you know me down to the T? I was being nice..

I really don't wanna go back to work.

I can't be with someone who doesn't wanna hear me sing majority of the day cuz that's all I do 😂

RT @ZackAEspinoza: I love this weather!!!!😁😁😁

But not.. Its strangely comfortable.

If you get mad because I don't snap back... It's because I hate snapchat and hardly use it. If I snap back you're lucky 😂

“@COLOProbs: It's about to go from 0 to 100 real quick. ❄️❄️❄️”

The Texan comes out in me when I get angry 😂

Fuck y'all I'm calling in tomorrow 👋

Second time I've had to train someone with no one to back me up 😒

Like I'm kewl wit dat

Mom gave me $20 because I "do everything all the time for no reason"

It's cool to be able to just take a day to myself and have everyone be like "eh it's okay, she does a lot for us."

Now whenever I call Emilio I get to say, "EMILIOOOOOOOOO"

Not only did they put on my plates for me, but they fixed the sensitivity of my pedals on my car so now I can drive easier 😍

“@CaptainStevo_: @valeenalives need to come back to Texas 😒” I'll be down for a visit soon 😁

So happy I put on makeup at least 😂

If I don't get his number I am going to be so disappointed in myself and my game. 😂

"How ironic that I'm here!"

"I know, I see you every day it's about time you come visit me! 😏"

Well Kari sucks at wingman so I'm gonna go get my oil changed and do this alone 😈

Why can't I ever talk to you 😩

Like why is it all about sex? Can I not just be alone and do my own thing? Cuuuz that's what I'm doing 💁

And I've had none lately soooo.

I realized people get too ahead of themselves and that's why we get hurt.

I certainly don't live in some fantasy world. I live in a deep part of our own world you will apparently never understand.

I will not be lonely by being myself. Either you accept that or you don't.

Know what's funny? I was til if I were to keep acting the way I do, I'd live a sad and lonely life. 😂

But seriously what does Amber rose do? I literally don't even know.

Is @CamMeekins ever coming to Colorado orrrr?

Lmao Nevermind I'm not spending $400 on that

“@alexandria_lara: "Okay what's the one big question you've come up with?" What am I suppose to do.”

Pretty sure I'm dying

Now I have to use my kief up 😭

I miss my best friends 😭

I have half a mind to buy a ticket across the world and just.... Wander

I have no one to go with me to the tattoo shop..

RT @VincentTorres47: I slept for 12 hours

I haven't slept in that late in forever

I'm just trying to chillll

RT @MODSUN: Listen to Howlin' At The Moon by Mod Sun #np on #SoundCloud https://t.co/lC7TNGITvU

You appear in me, I in you,

@VincentTorres47 hahaha I'm just out Vincent I have no cash 😂 I could get it in a sec if I wanted to but I'm being lazy today

But I lack in weed and rillos

I just wanna roll a blunt

It makes me mad when people don't talk the way they type.

But happy Valentine's Day to everyone I love 💕

Is there anything I haven't done today 😒

Lmfao I'm so lame. I'm just gonna go home at 11 and sit there 😂

You act like more of a girl than I do. 😂

Let It Breathe/Jaden Smith is just... Holy fuck

T-minus one hour before I find out if Kari is the best or worst wingman ever

I enjoy someone who has some depth behind their eyes 😍

All I said was "awe"

"Good, I was wondering. 😏"

I'm so horrible at initiating conversation with someone I'm interested in 😂

You really changed. Change is good. When you said don't let the city change you, I think it should.

And she knows who I am and everything 💛

RT @jtijerina77: All I really want for Valentine's day. Any day really lol @krispykreme http://t.co/2v1iQLrHIM

What the fuck man Joe opens Wednesday and I'm not even working that day 😡

https://t.co/TM7fIFoQJQ

I'm picky with my men because I deserve to be.

Lmao yeah right I'm a broke bitch. In my dreams 😂

One day I'll be sexy enough to own a pair of Guiseppes.

Like if I'ma be stuck back here at least give me something to look at 💁

RT @TrinaOrtiz_5: Give me a bottle of Ciroc on Valentine's Day and I'll be solid. ✊

Don't pretend to be interested if you aren't. I don't play that, so I don't expect you to.

Swear I'm so damn tired of being the taxi

It feels so weird when everyone leaves. It gets so quiet lol

I wonder what compelled you to talk to me after so long 😒

It's stunning

But hey I'm gonna look great eventually so totally worth it

I'm gonna be sore tomorrow. I can feel it 😔

If anything I think I just get pressure into "taking a chance" lol

Looks like I'm gonna go see Skizzy on March 21st 😏

Seriously fucking love Brian, he knew I was a little frustrated so he comes out, hands me a cheesecake and says,"they'll be brighter days."

AND congrats to @DeAundraBrooke! I hope baby is just as beautiful as J! 😊

Happy Birthday @LaneyAnn_! I hope you've had a great day and bless you and your perfect little family! ☺️🎉🎁

LILY IS HERE 😍😍😍

She's the Man will always be a movie I love

Sometimes I wish I could talk to you.

RT @tiana_lovee10: I've always wanted to try macaroons.

@PreacherChubz55 Hey buddy, I miss you and if you need anything please let me know, even if I'm far. Your family is in my prayers. 🙏

Not too sure what it is but I feel something coming

I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much, all of the while, I never knew... All of the while it was you.

No lie I've lost quite a bit of weight from not eating so much due to my piercing 😅

Do I really need to go to Life in Color? No... But.... 💁

RT @HogwartsLogics: Dementor 1: I hate this job 

Dementor 2: I know; it's soul destroying 

One day my husband will wake up early to make coffee and talk to me all morning. I will settle for nothing less 😂

I don't wanna do anything today lol

It was cloudy and all yesterday. Today, there is snow on the friend and it's somewhat sunny.

I've felt very at peace today. 🙏

RT @TraciLynn4_: I expected alittle more from you.

I felt like I was 10 years old again 😁

Jake and I today at the museum:

"DINOSAURS"

One day I'll find someone to dance with me lol

I'm just happy it's pancake day

@samanthaleigh_8 😂 I'll be there soon!

@samanthaleigh_8 when I'm there I'll buy you all the food you want

Hi there, dark friend. Nice of you to visit, maybe when you leave I'll go with you.

I just like to laugh and have fun. Just laugh and have fun with me 😁

That's how I get close to you, I like to be a lil smartass and mess with you. Half the shit I say I'm just messing around lmao

GOD everyone is so uptight! like I'm just fucking with you man, mess with me back if you want idgaf.

I try my hardest to be patient with people who are back and forth with their decisions. I really do.

As if I'm in middle school again 😂

I'm just happy I get a 3 day weekend and my best friend is coming over

A cute ass guy better come in and compliment me or some shit cause I'm so over today 😂

All I did today was smoke with Kari, come home, and sleep all day.

Blew my speaker cause it can't handle how loud I want my music 😒

I have my read receipts on and I don't care if I'm watching the bubble.

RT @tateerrzz: Dear lord where can I move to find beautiful men like these? 👅🔥 http://t.co/XvnaBnGJJX

I wanna shower but I wanna run...

I love her fideo

My step mom is making me fideo cause I can't eat anything 😍

If you look like you came straight out the 50's I'ma look at you like 😍😭

I asked to be put in the back for lunch and Lisa looks at me like 😧

At least I'm working 💁

Lmao I'm so lame. I need a new job.

It sucks never having anyone to smoke with 😔

At least I'm getting a good check this week 💁

Why the fuck am I here

And I'm asked to go do something for someone when they're ALREADY fucking leaving

I JUST said how I'm trying not to fucking waste my gas in 3 days like I just did driving around for fucking everyone

I haven't felt peace within myself for a while. That's all I want.

Everything is just so loud. I just want stillness.

This is just too much in too little time I haven't even had time to just relax.

Kid is 14, but I'm glad he cares to know I'm alright.

Aww Emilio is so cute lol, he came upstairs asking what happened last night like in full detail to make sure I was okay.

"I could never make anything as beautiful as you."

You come back, I don't fall for it. I shut that shit down.

Like what more could you need than the love of your child? Money? Women? Idk it's just fucked up.

RT @xoxo_celestee: “@valeenalives: Celeste is gonna flip out when she reads my text 😂😏 She'll probably die of laughter” I died of laugher 👌😂

I hope you make peace with your pain, and never lose your flames.

I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else, take me as I am or be left alone.

Tears on the Runway pt 2 on repeat bc I'm going through it 😂

Maybe I'm just scared to go all in. Never wasn't much for the life of gambling.

I should be asleep 🙈

I don't do things for no reason. Eventually it has a purpose.

I'm in love with the sounds and vibrations of people's voices 😍

I always know what I'm doing

I miss the shit out of my friends 💔

That shit was my favorite. And I always had you with me..

"Music does more than get me through the day, it's who I am."

I feel things that don't need to be said.

@Galvez_Brittany you know I love you 😘

I miss the girls soooo much.

I have a whole album dedicated to my Eazy concerts

When all my favorite people are working I have THE best work days 😁

RT @DeveanIsack: I'd love to be able to hang out with someone and just listen to music, and like not talk

RT @BlaydenVibes: I guess what I'm saying is, use your skills to your advantage and don't just work for money. Love what you do and people …

Did I just see him dance?😂

Idk how I'm managing to be calm right now

I can't deal lol

I just can't

I deal awfully with negative energy. I panic and sound stupid as fuck.

If I'm not singing out loud or to myself that means something is not right in my life 😂

So I put on Things I Can't Change and my sister goes, "Who is this? Neck Deep?" 

Sounds silly, but I never get ready when I'm going through shit. So the fact I did says something.

I almost cried, but then I remembered I actually tried to look decent today for once so I didn't cause of my mascara.

My morning drives are so important to me. My music basically sets my mood and I didn't get to listen to shit.

@samanthaleigh_8 I would hope so 😂

“@samanthaleigh_8: “@valeenalives: If you're wondering, I am extremely high in my avi.” *sober 😐” cuz u lame as fuuuck

I wanna sock my manager in the throat.

But I mean I like it cause I feel like it's an accurate portrayal of me when I am high. 😂

@VincentTorres47 well I mean some people are stupid. It's a pretty good selfie for being baked as fuck 💁

If you're wondering, I am extremely high in my avi.

@VincentTorres47 that's you being financially responsible cuz I got the same problem

My lavender incense smells so amazing with the weather being so nice I get to leave my window open 🌾🌿

I feel so anxious right now but what for lol

If Eazy was 4 years younger I'd find a way to marry him

RT @ECHOisthename: I'm a god

It's like I'm the only one who knows what the fuck I'm doing here rn.

Let's just say if Evan doesn't at least talk to me about management after today. I'll be pissed lmao

I look not so fab every day soo 😂

I work at 5 every day this week... 😒

Holy damn I'm tired

I wish I could've learned to love myself a long time ago instead of now. But now is as good as any time. Better, actually.

Loving yourself does not make you incapable of loving someone else. In fact, it makes it so much easier.

Lmao I've eaten one thing since Saturday

I'm so drained.. That was such a hard drive

I just want sleep.

And I said its okay that I didn't need it.

I just found the lighter you gave me six months ago because it matches my phone

I feel better alone.

RT @DeveanIsack: So much edge, man.

RT @mxrirxe: I'm just gonna move on with my life. Yeah, it breaks my heart but I'll get over it sooner than later.

Maybe I’m so evil I attract all of these tragedies⁰Maybe we’re so graceful we create all of these masterpieces

I fuck everything up, lol what's new?

I got a nose bleed for the first time in years today it sucked lol

I'm pretty sure I know what I'm deserving of.

Just stop already fuck I'm so done with feeling like shit

I didn't think I'd ever feel this way again. I thought I'd heard it all.

I'm just really hurt now and I'm tired of being really hurt so idk I'm just gonna run until I can't feel angthing

No one should have to explain themselves. And I've gotten tired of it.

I promised someone that I would be my first priority.

Sooo I'm only excited about going back home for spring break cause 

I could sound like an insane maniac and they'd be like "nah, I get it."

My dog won't leave me alone and I think it's just cause he knows I'm feeling shitty

I should simply be.

I shouldn't even be in my head lol

I'm so sensitive and as much as it doesn't show, things are so much different in my head.

When I'm feeling hopeless I just hug my mom and end up crying

Growing my eyebrows out is so easy I just hate it cause I feel like a cave woman

I was jamming TSSF at 4:30 in the morning on the way to work 😂

Holy damn I'm tired

@samanthaleigh_8 I love you💛

RT @uhlexcya: “I don't want someone who just talks about the weather.” http://t.co/t7wajHww58

This lady today was like, "I love your hair it's SOOO thick. And your eyelashes are gorgeous!!"

It made my heart smile 😭💛

I don't have to desire to be better for anyone but myself, so the fact I'm actually doing so makes me feel great about everything.

Yeeeeuhhhh I'm just gonna run

RT @princes_christi: I think guys are far more dramatic then girls

My baby looks so damn sexy since I washed her yesterday 😍🚗

No matter how I think we grow, you always seem to let me know, that I'm crazy

I kind of want to get a cat

RT @kaylaaa_Dawg16: You know... all I want in life rn is a blunt.

Well now I have no plans so idk what do I do lol

When people have no interest in something that I'm excited about it makes me sad as fuck

I still have the schedule they gave us first day of senior year 😭

I'm thinking too much I need to run

Like tell me I'm an idiot, I know I'm not so I don't givashit

Cause as much as customers piss me off I'm always too chilled out for thats shit

I love that all my managers constantly commend me for doing good and always staying and never bitching

Hoping my boyfriend has a day off this weekend so he can stay with me but I know he's got the overnights 😒

I need to remember to do the things I like to do

I just wanna go home and chill and go for a run

I need to gain my confidence back because somewhere along the road here I lost it lol

I swear I can't to anything right..

I haven't laughed so hard in such a long time. My mom and uncle are more like roomies 😂

@Shlarmanda @samantha_leigh6 just move here god damnit I have a huge ass house 😭

@samantha_leigh6 @Shlarmanda btw I'm going crazy without yall

@samantha_leigh6 @Shlarmanda whatever you'd just hit us enough to knock us over and be like "OMG DID I HURT YOU"

I miss having people to smoke with

“@samantha_leigh6: I wish Valeena was in Texas.” Me too 😔

I don't let shit bother me, and if I do it's for a damn good reason.

When someone says they got me I know they mean it.

I cannot deal with the idiocy around me

Can I please just relive last night for the rest of my life? It was too good

I might just keep these plugs in forever I love them

But I kinda don't give a shit 💁

Ultimately I'm gonna do what I wanna do. I'm too independent for my own good.

If I want to go to a concert, I'm fucking going. To me that's my favorite place to be in the whole world.

Like idk I have a lot of people get upset with me but like idgaf because I'm still gonna go if I wanna go.

I already feel everything changing 😊

I love that feeling!

All I really need is my makeup lmao

Sitting here like "oh no I need my stuff" 

I LOVE the moon.💛🌝

Probs why I'm still up

Can't get over the fact I'm seeing Eazy for the third time tomorrow 😱😍😁

I am enjoying myself http://t.co/SWxacTscLy

Holy fuck I didn't realize how exhausted I was until I'm sitting here half asleep bc I've had none

So I came home to all my family and they made my whole day 💛

I've been so lost for as long as I can remember

I tried so hard not to just lose it today, but the moment I shut my car door strength wasn't an option.

If I could disappear into my dreams..

Btw I haven't clocked out

It's always been me that's wrong, nothing new.

I don't wanna be here. I don't wanna be anywhere

After I've looked at myself 6618628683 times I'm just like whatever I don't care

Lol I'm praying my horoscope is right

Lmao I'm not even going to look half as good as I would like.. Never enough time

Wtf to I even wear. 😐

You might hate my words, but you know that I'm right, you know that I'm right.

Lol no no I don't

I sing A Part of Me at the top my lungs every time lol

Intelligence is like the greatest quality, I love to learn so teach me 😁

I never understood the connection but now I get it.

I have work at 5 am tomorrow but I wanna get fucked up er something cuz I don't give two fucks.

Lmao I love Brian 😂

Ive realized that the world is just one big "I know exactly how I feel I just won't be true to it because it's morally wrong" kind of place

@xoxo_celestee I did not. 😐 

RT @kid_chemo: Hope I meet your expectations jk I don't even meet my own

Dance with me when I feel like dancing, let me sing to you when I feel like singing, feel my music the way I do, live in the vibrations.

You taught me so much.. It's only now I'm starting to understand what you meant. Namastè. 🙏

@OhhliviaLee Right I wish 😂

@OhhliviaLee I was told by a coworker they thought I was 21 😂

@LastRichardHere awe I know I'll be there during March to see yall!

“@LastRichardHere: @valeenalives or ghost hunt idk anything lol” Yessss I miss that

@LastRichardHere lmao if I wasn't 1,000 miles away I would totally now that I know how to get on one. 😂

I'm never alone ✨ I'm always reminded I am a part of something bigger 💛 http://t.co/2vRW8UNrTU

I'm going to change it one day.

Lol now you know why I'm so fucked up

She hates it when I shout these words, but I'll still sing for you.

So hold back your views, cause we're both leaving soon, I can't fall back on you, cause that's not what I do.

I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way, cause you gotta be safe.

@VincentTorres47 omg yum! Lucky you all the ones I've em had were homemade and not too great, but hey it got the job done :)

"I know

I like to dance in my room alone because it's hella fun

I fit into my skinny pants again 🙌

Where would I be without you beautiful souls I can consider my family? 💛

RT @Shlarmanda: It's bad that humans can make other humans feel less than them. We're equal. Point blank.

So that's the thing, I'm not as great as I could be.. And I agree.. I almost never am.

Wait for me to fail then you got the wrong person, I am not an earthling.

If I had a dollar for every time I've heard "never mind"

3 new songs.. I can't... Dead...

RT @DeveanIsack: I could never live in sinton again

At least I woke up feeling a lot better 😁

My New Years resolution is to love myself a lot more, because I am all I have. 💛

I just feel it eating at me.

It's never gonna go away for me. No one will ever get that.

I feel like shit

I'm so frustrated lol

I feel like only one soul in the universe understands me to a depth I can't get myself.

I need a bob in my life I've been 5 months without one

Tbh I love being alone

@samantha_leigh6 who else would I want here more than you two lol

I just want my best friends here really 😔

I just want Sam here with me 😭

@samantha_leigh6 This summer, please. I'd love to have you here and you could live with me 😭

“@samantha_leigh6: I really wanna smoke with Valeena in Colorado." 

I'm never cutting my hair ever again

I love it 😍

Lately I look forward to my dreams.

But you've always been too stubborn to believe that so I let you be and talk your talk

Don't think I don't care, cause I always will.

Don't think I never think about you, I do. I always remember the best instead of the worst though.

RT @Outgageous: I feel like going crazy.

Definitely leaving this weekend. I can't take it anymore

If I don't have anything to do for New Years I'm gonna be pretty upset

2) Its not the original

I've never felt so shitty lol

That was the worst night of sleep I've ever gotten

Lol I should not be smoking but I don't give a fuck

@Shlarmanda something dude. I don't get sick unless I'm missing someone or something, so it must be 😂

RT @reesecantu: Trying so hard but feel like I'm getting no where

Forreal I haven't felt this sick in a few years lol

I feel like death.

Sleepless, stressing bout success. I light &amp; pass the dro. Every now and then these things do happen though.

Tryin to see every state, no white lighters, hope I see 28.

Man, shit I try my best, nobody here for me to try and impress.

Lol @ me cause I'm forever making typos

Patience is key and I had none at that point

RT @of_wild_things: I'm a joker 

I'm a smoker

I'm a midnight toker

Trying to figure out why I got sick when I already know 😒

I wanted to go to Decadence so bad

@savannahsaysso wtf I hate you

RT @HornyFacts: I love this so much http://t.co/4pQEifrmEV

“@xoxo_celestee: “@ImHighCat: Being high as fuck at McDonald's trying to read the menu like http://t.co/vr3cSEednD” @valeenalives 😂😂😂😂” omfg

Sometimes, I feel you everywhere.

I really love to dance. I just never do it cause no one wants to lol

I swear the life I live is unreal. The worst things happen to me, but I get the most amazing rewards that make it blissful.

I feel like shiiiiiet

Willing to go through getting sick every winter at least once every year (cuz I hardly get sick) for a white winter in Colorado ❄️⛄️

Lol I'm slowly losing my voice 😛

I'm never not high

RT @_NEEENAH: and I'll tweet what the fuck I want about WHATEVER I WANT

Yall don't know how happy I am that there's like 4+ inches of snow outside 😍

I have an amazing and beautiful life with some great doors open for me. I'm focusing on that rather than petty drama.

I'm chillin. 😌

Are you trying to piss me off? It's not working. 😊 I just think it's funny people have to stoop that low in order to try.

But I'm also reminded of why it's home.

I am constantly reminded of why I left Texas lol 

So today, I was painting my nails and Keep It Trill came on and I was like, "CHRISTIAN" 😂 @TGOD__16

When people have nothing better to do but to do shit in spite of me I just sit in amusement. 😌

To be completely honest, I feel like many efforts I make will ever be enough.

I love it ❄️❄️

It's been snowing like nonstop since yesterday and it's supposed to keep going for the week 😅

So happy I could spend time sitting with my family playing card games just testing how well we knew each other 💛

It's sad but at least I can sit here and appreciate the good moments

So my mom gave me my infinity bracelet that I got from you last year and my heart broke a lil bit

I'm so happy 😭

HOLY SHIT I GOT A RECORD PLAYER 😍😍😍😍☺️

I haven't even thought of my own presents. I hardly expect any actually. M just wondering what everyone else got 😂

It's 8:10 and buelo is already drunk enough to be singing his Mexican songs 😐

Lol see what I did

RT @KevinLyman: It's time to unplug, disconnect, enjoy the moment and reflect on how we can treat other's as well as yourself better in the…

I absolutely love my hair when I have the time to do it 😍

@DeveanIsack my aunt did that last year  for all the adults and they all had a nerf gun war while presents were being opened

I said the only reason I'd go back was for her and the real friends I left with

@badbxtchbelle I miss you too ya lil bitch 😭💕

Intellectual conversations are very interesting to me

I miss having people to smoke with all the time and talk to all deeply

RT @MenstruaI: When you realize there's only 3 more days till Christmas 🎅🎁🎄 http://t.co/hWnXnUOXIM

RT @robertluis97: I hate the fact that I can never sleep in😒

There's a Buddhist temple less than 2 blocks away and I have yet to visit

RT @DeveanIsack: I'm at my happiest when I'm alone in my car, singing along to Title Fight

I'll never feel like I'm good enough for anyone again.

I'm trying, man.

One more hour and I'm freeeeee

"I mean the only thing; the best thing I like about myself... is you."

I sometimes dislike operating on such a unique frequency cause no one understands my train of thought

What kind of conversation am I having

I love telling people things that stick in their head after we've spoken. Things that help them get through every day.

If you're lucky enough, you get to hear me inspire you.

“@lostmyseIf: if my heart was an emoji http://t.co/9lTq8Kwz3s” @xoxo_celestee

I miss Gage I feel like I've hardly seen him this past week

I got such a good check this week, I have like $300 I can blow.

I love my car ❤️

I feel the earth loving me today. ☺️🍃💕

Been in back for two days straight today. I'm not complaining man I like it in my zone back there

It was funnier cause I was baked 😂

@xoxo_celestee @Samantha_S1810 my next day off is Sunday, but I get off work at 2 tomorrow so I'm free after that

I told her she was so cool lol

I feel like the frequencies I'm receiving are very high

I want to do something so significant but I'm not sure where to start

I'm just wanting so much more, it's just this feeling I'be had my whole life.

Might hurt them but it's better than being lied to, I would know.

If you feel something missing, or that you're supposed to be somewhere you're not, then leave and be where you're supposed to.

It baffles me.

I wonder what people feel like when they cheat on the only person they'll ever really love.

I love hand written letters.

I just want to read and I have no books left 😭💔

All I want in life is the LOTR books 😭😭

Please excuse my foul appearance, but look what I got today. 😁 Thank you to dad, for the help, I love… http://t.co/yep0lrv7uO

Yeah fuck y'all I did that shit by myself!!

GUESS WHO JUST BOUGHT HER FIRST CAR 😍😁

I wish I had time to enjoy myself like I used to.

I'm just in a shitty place and no one gets it lol

And it sucks cause I have the money to get a car but my dad hasn't had a day off for weeks so we can actually go get it.

Like I'm sorry guys I literally have no way to get anywhere as of right now. 😭

I haven't seen anyone because I don't have a car to get anywhere and it's really bothering me cause everyone's getting pissed off.

I like to talk about life more than myself.

I wanna sit in a parked car until 3 am with someone smoking and talking about the world.

Sometimes I hate that people know follow me on tumblr. Like those are my thoughts n shit ur reading I don't want y'all seeing it lmao

I think it's hilarious when people use a big word incorrectly because they don't know what it means 😂

I like how I don't hear from Christian for weeks then he'll just tell me his whole fuckin life story in 5 min

Reminiscing my summer. Probably the best I've ever had and I'll be surprised if another comes close.

RT @BlaydenVibes: I hate twitter

It's no wonder I haven't felt good. 😔

I'm disappointed in myself for not keeping up with things to make my body and mind feel better.

I don't meditate enough. It helped me today but not as much as it should have.

I get on Twitter and it is the sole reason I have no hope that the human race will ever evolve.

I mean thank you for being so concerned though 😅

I said I felt sick and my stepmom asked if I was pregnant. Like wtf no dude I just feel sick... Like a cold. Y'know cough and chills

So my boyfriend just asked if I've seen Sharknado and all I could think of was you guys @jmv32_ 😂

RT @ECHOisthename: I really try not to repeat myself on this shit. it's a waste of time for me and you.

Tbh I just don't care anymore. If I am then I am. No use crying over spilled milk, I'll just clean it up.

Sometimes I get a feeling that I'm being fucked with so bad

Lmao k I'm done. Have a good night and be safe if you're out and about tonight people 😊

Just cut the bullshit already damn all I want to do is make others happy, but I won't sacrifice my own to do so.

Instead of being so negative, you should do the same.

RT @texasbeauty_: I wanna go on a dateeeeeeee.

That's just me though. If you think he's sexy then whatevs, cool. 👍

Justin Bieber looks like a faggot I swear

"Does it look like I'm crying? I have a piece of my contact stuck in my eye"

And I was the first one here

As soon as I move in getting a dog for myself I don't give two shits what my mom has to say

K cause I talked to you exactly how I talked to the 5 people you saw before you.

I hope, I pray, that I get to get my car today. 🙏

I'm really happy to be with someone so considerate of me.

In my head, every time I take a step it's on the clouds ☁️

I need my car asap. Life just got so difficult without one.

@xoxo_celestee okay well I got nada. You can come get me if you want

@xoxo_celestee wtf I haven't even gotten anything

So regardless, I'm super proud of the pirates for keeping the tradition well alive. But I BETTER see that y'all are going to state tonight 😉

@krissyisa_bamf You'll find it one day! 😊 just be confident about it! It's worth the waiting though 😉

I think that's why Gage is the perfect fit. He's always bein a lil shit so it never gets boring and I'm never short on laughs 💕

When I'm trying to be cute and the convo does a 360 http://t.co/3kkC5ARhR5

It's cold as fuck and I love it 💕

If anything why not just talk to me about it?

Never did I once doubt that you saved me. But fuck, I had to save myself too, and that wasn't easy to do.

Don't act as if I never offered to be there for you. You're the one who thinks you're too good for all that.

I need to stop fighting things and simply let them be the way they are. 💕

A connection so deep, I'm unsure we understand it in its entirety, going beyond the reality we live in.

"Don't tell me you know me because I'm an ocean and you have only seen the horizon."

No one will ever understand me from the inside out. They'll never know what I know. All the secrets the universe whispers to me.

“@Shlarmanda: I just want to be okay... 😔”

Wanting someone who needs you is completely different from wanting someone who actually wants to need you.. If that makes sense

What makes you think that I can't think like an adult? Every time you ask me something in a step ahead of you.

Like I already don't feel good. Dfwm.

I'm an awful person 😭

It was the sweetest thing I've probably ever heard from a random person

Today I had someone tell me, "You have a smile that could light up a room. Just had to tell you, though I'm sure you get it a lot."

I still feel pieces of you on me

Lmao I hate when I get like this. All I need is a bowl and I'll be good 😌

It's really weird lol

I've been feeling so out of place lately, like I just don't belong

I work with children playing fucking games all the time.

Yet at the same time I'm in love with everything I see and can touch or feel and hear

I all of a sudden have this loathing of everything physically manifested.. I don't want to be here

But I close it right away bc frostbite

I love the snow but holy fuck I really need to get used to the Colorado cold again 😫

Not thinking of any certain situation, not feeling any certain way. I'm simply awake, while you're sleeping inside your shell.

Most of the time when you think I'm angry or something I'm not, I'm just not having any thoughts. I'm being present.

I really love plugs but putting my tapers in again makes me happy. 😁

For once someone seems to get that sometimes when I say "I got it" or "I'm completely fine, why?"

My cousin Isaac is probs one of my favorite people he's a fuckin trip

So I went to my house yesterday, and since its getting cleaned, I found a bong in the trash. 

You don't know how bad I wanted to take it. 😔

Just realized I'm back where I was like.. Two weeks ago. 😒

I don't really mind back booth, just cause I'm in my own zone for a while.

@xoxo_celestee lmfao this actually helped because I would say something like that 😂

I'm excited because I'm going with Hanna and Kari for pancakes 😍

I invite the pure light of the sun into my heart. May it shine from my heart to the world. 🙏

I love being able to watch the world get lighter as the sun comes up. I like waking up with the sun.

I was doing so good and now I hate waking up again bc all I wanna do is sleep.

I don't love myself enough to let someone else love me.

Idk I'm not all that excited about my birthday now that I think about it. My expectations aren't set high at all.

I'm so bummed today, so I'm gonna let myself feel sad and accept it, so it can go away.

When there's too much on my mind, all I want is to take a drive through the mountains.

But I mean it's colorado so duh.

It's 41 degrees and sunny as fuck.

It don't have to be miracles, the fire's within our souls.

I'm actually glad I stayed home tonight.

I just realized the only thing I want for my birthday is to go to the Butterfly Pavillion.

I have 4 siblings and all of their favorite foods, including myself, is Alfredo pasta.

I saw the most beautiful Australian Shepard today at work I had to pet it and everything. I fell in love with it 😍

HOLY FUCK MY BIRTHDAY IS NEXT WEEK 😁

I'm waiting for someone who makes me WANT to better myself and actually do it, instead of making me feel like I have to.

But I'm taking my time with that. I won't settle for someone who makes me feel like I need to work on myself.

Y'know, I really don't need a someone, I can do without and be just as happy, but I still want one.

Gonna get Ismael a "Mr. Universe" sash to wear cuz he thinks he's hot shit

@samantha_leigh6 LMFAO not you! 😂 I know you look at my shit everyday but that's cause you're my best friend 💁

I will forever love my step moms food 💛

I feel u

Or like I want to

What the fuck Cliff I didn't get to pop a balloon 😒

RT @velvetgh0st: I can't stop staring at beautiful men and it's making me sad, I want a beautiful man

@_NEEENAH I just concentrate so much easier 💁

RT @_NEEENAH: “@valeenalives: I do my makeup 10x better when I'm high. 😅” DUDE RT!!! 👏😂

I do my makeup 10x better when I'm high. 😅

Ismael thinks he's funny putting stickers on my back. Nobody even told me 😒

Yes... I believe so.

Am I willing to spend majority of my first paycheck on a tattoo?

So happy I don't work that long today.

Sometimes I wonder if people get nervous to talk to me. 

You shouldn't... I'm pretty fuckin cool 😎

I'll go to Skylab and Tiësto by myself this weekend if I have to lol I wanna vibe

Omfg I thought I went into work at 7 and I decided to check my schedule again and I go in at 10 😁

Of course I'm guilty of that myself, I'm only human, and it's just a part of learning.

I mean, you just create a bunch of problems in your head and make them come true, yourself is what's hurting you.

I hate that people believe love hurts. Love doesn't hurt people. It's a pure emotion, no negativity exists in love.

Idfk what I'm doing http://t.co/UoRSepoSvq

@samantha_leigh6 @Shlarmanda I know. I'm sad because I haven't seen y'all 😭

So uh.. I really wanna go to Skylab this weekend.

If I'm not working, I'm home watching Cosmos.

If Ismael calls me Newbie one more time I'm gonna kick him. 😂

Fuck it. One day I'm going to write a story; a great one. Just watch me.

Every time I ask myself "why?" 

I hear a "why not?" In the back of my head 😒😂

I will give your heart a place to rest when everything you have has turned and left..

@celestial_gomez lol that feeling doesn't go away. I have 0s now and I feel like they're small 😅

Last night was a good night. I'm happy we all got to feel like 10 yrs old again. 😊

Lmao you ain't gotta lie I know I'm fucking up but thank you anyways you kind soul. 😁💁

I was taking forever trying to order this girl's food and she asks if I'm new and when I say yes she says, "Don't worry you're doing good!"😊

So I go on break and forgot money to eat and the old man in line behind me just paid for my food ☺️

I was vibing the fuck out it was perfect 😍

You don't know what I'm capable of.

I sat out in like 35 degree weather all night why am I not sick or something lmao

The concert was fucking nuts. I had so much fun. I feel like I saw everyone 😁

I like that my ticket says "Rain or Shine" 

Like hell yeah I'll freeze my ass off for you. 😋

Happy birthday @Charrni! 😍🎉 I hope you have an awesome day today, wish I was there to see you! 💛

It's not that long, but when I have a concert to look forward to, 3pm seems like forfuckingever away.

I like work cause I don't think about anything. I'm just hustlin' all day. 😎

I was made to help people. I love figuring people out and helping them realize how amazing they can be.

WTF BRUH I just wanna be sexy as fuck 😭

But at least I'll be here when they do think of me 😊

Y'know what bugs the fuck outta me? When I tell people I'm here for them, and I MEAN IT, but they don't think of me when they need someone.

Guys I'm just like oozing excitement rn for tomorrow 😁

But I'm okay. When aren't I? I have more than everything that I need. I'm loved. I needn't ask for more.

And now I'm here like wtf man..

Sometimes I miss the fuck out of you and it sucks.

It's gonna be cold as tits but so worth it 😏

I'm super fucking excited for the concert tomorrow! 😁

I have some chubby ass cheeks.

I've always admired the relationship between my dad and step mom. They completely embrace their individuality, but they're like bffs.

50 degrees. I'm cold lol

I am not afraid or ashamed of how I feel and when I feel it.

Cause that's exactly what I do. I may not like what you do, but I will motivate you do it if it's what YOU want and you need someone there.

My favorite people are the ones that go through life saying, "I would never do such a thing, but don't listen to me. This is your life."

@alexandria_lara If you can, try checking this album out, this is what's helped me unlock all of my chakras.😊 http://t.co/h7YCGrix8N

@alexandria_lara videos are good too! I could give you an endless amount of pointers, but it's all about how you learn best. ☺️

@alexandria_lara If it helps you any, every time you meditate, work on all of your chakras. Start from your base, and work up.

@alexandria_lara lol yeah I know how that goes. Of course I can help you! 😊

@alexandria_lara Watchu talkin bout? You still can! 💁 We're both children of the universe, anytime you wanna talk I'm here! 😊

@Peachyally I'll send you some. 💁

So I keep telling this dude I want a painting he's working on and he just keeps sending pictures to me... Like nigga..... Gimme.

Y'know what...... I'm chillin. 😎

@samantha_leigh6 Today a car full of hot blondes with the prettiest eyes, tattoos, and gauges came through and I wanted to die

If you're in highschool complaining you don't know a subject ASK YOUR TEACHER. Teachers are there for you to ask them questions!

“@kaylaaa_Dawg16: I enjoy nature.” 

@They_want_the_B Definitely just let me know so I can see when I'm not working!

@They_want_the_B Yes! I've been for about a month now :)

@They_want_the_B I would've gone totally, but I don't have friends lmao plus I'm working

@They_want_the_B I've been wanting to go to that concert! Lucky butt

I actually really like working, because it's giving me something to do all day.

Happy Birthday @mckenzieisrael!🎉😊 I hope you have a blessed day full of lots of laughter, beautiful! I miss you! ☺️💛

RT @heythereleslie: I don't give anyone a chance. But when I do, I'm stuck on that person for awhile.

RT @_NEEENAH: Idgaf about anything that you're telling me, cause right now it's all irrelevant I'm so high I won't remember it

Or, more importantly I hope I get into some shit. 😈

I hope someone does something rad as fuck for me on my birthday this year.

😂 I'm a dumbass don't pay attention to me

I know nothing.

But I am here to learn.

First day of work went well, and I found out how many hotties go through the drive thru in the mornings 😏

I have gotten so much better since then. 😌

Lol.. I wonder if you still have my mandala.

You had no idea how exciting this was for me. I love getting new shit. http://t.co/4pKEONanlW

I'm moving to Golden when I decide to settle down somewhere. Beautiful mountain town!

I can totally make the concert on Wednesday. But I literally just want to go to see @G_Eazy 😋

Forreal, if I ever bust out dancing I'ma want my bae to jump in with me.💃

I need a dance partner 😉

Lol no I'm sticking with integrative healthcare 😁

Idk psychology sounds like fun

It's been cloudy lately. Me gusta 😍

RT @Peachyally: I'm so bad at making friends. Idk why because I'm frickin awesome.

I definitely feel more myself now 💁

So sometimes the urge to cut my bangs is too much.... And I do it... Because I fucking can 💁 http://t.co/TwkuBH9sOL

Not a day goes by that I don't drive with my windows down. 😌
