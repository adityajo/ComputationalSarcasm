No key defenders for the dogs in the draft means more time for Talia and fletcher hopefully. Pumped to get caleb Daniel! @westernbulldogs

@Sachk0 agree. Defended him for ages, it's got to be a mental thing?

Seriously what's going on with Derrick rose. I'm his biggest fan but it's getting riddiculous

@Sachk0 same. Hope they play McDermott &amp; mirotic to spread the floor for jimmy

Pretty late with this one but congrats to @BobMurphy02 on being the Doggies new skipper. Quality guy and very well deserved

I hope the Dogs hold onto Cooney. He can still play, and more importantly, we need some older heads to help the young guys

Great article today by @RalphyHeraldSun on the Doggies. He is spot on

@krismiller79 @sexycushion ha! Don't get greedy. You are still well ahead with scully!

The fact Jones want to leave the Dogs shows how bad our management is &amp; I don't blame him. We played him in the 2s all year...

Leaving the race track as everyone is getting here... Doesn't make sense!

Remarkably Melbournes flag odds have halved since the free agency / trade period! Still massive outsiders $501 into $251. Dawes a factor?

Crows $1.50 favs to win in rd 1 over Essendon $2.55. Eagles $1.80 Dockers $2 Blues $1.75 Tigers $2.05 Hawks $1.44 Cats $2.75

@krismiller79 @sexycushion @DrewPurcy @cws138 u are gonna have a massive forward line, especially when hogan is ready!

@sexycushion @DrewPurcy @krismiller79 @cws138 couple of weeks? Pretty sure first tweet was Monday

@DrewPurcy @krismiller79 @sexycushion @cws138 I actually had no dramas getting him, just not for 21 and 47

@ClarkyHeraldSun please tell me the Dawes for 21 and 47 isn't true! Isn't even worth 21 by itself

@JamesDiBlasi11 we have top tote for races. Get the best tote price automatically. No one else has thst

@JamesDiBlasi11 what do u like to bet on

@DrewPurcy yeah. I mean u are right. Just think we could have been stronger given the hawks were desperate for a full back

@DrewPurcy they don't have a track record of compensation? The formula for free agents is different to losing players to suns/giants

@DrewPurcy we wouldn't have got ziltch if he was a free agent. Would have been compensated

@Aaron_McD @Jenkins23Rob they would consider it

@TysDensley @anthonyalsop they traded lake for pick 41 and a 6pick upgrade from 27 to 21. Very bad deal for the bulldogs

Ordinary for dogs if true! RT @SammyHeraldSun: Believe Deal is Lake &amp; No.27 to Hawks for 21 &amp; 41.

Jack Martin going to the suns... The western bulldogs @BigFootyDogs is going to have a melt down

@D_Hudson84 @krismiller79 I'm sick but I'm only coming so i get to spend quality time with duddo

Adelaide pair Pat Dangerfield and Scott Thompson also really well backed. Danger into $8 from $12 and Thommo into $9 from $10

Daniel talia looks home for the rising star. We have closed the market on it. He closed at $1.65. Was once as big as $81! @sportsbetcomau
