@pdxcreep @AntwonGalante @Utahrd @ComradeM @ProtectYourNet cocoa puffs donuts, please!

@AntwonGalante @Utahrd @pdxcreep @ComradeM @ProtectYourNet I know. But the original is always better!

@Utahrd @ComradeM @AntwonGalante @ProtectYourNet are we going to PDX to get them?

@ComradeM @AntwonGalante @Utahrd @ProtectYourNet major league friendship is getting to a whole new level.

@ComradeM @AntwonGalante @Utahrd @ProtectYourNet don't threaten us with good time now. And Rick will get to try Mal√∂rt!

@AntwonGalante @Utahrd @ProtectYourNet @ComradeM balls and booze. What else do you need?

@AntwonGalante @Utahrd @ProtectYourNet @ComradeM you ruined my spurs joke, asshole! But those are good.

@Utahrd @ProtectYourNet @ComradeM @AntwonGalante so, fried chicken will be served?

@ProtectYourNet @ComradeM congrats! @AntwonGalante and I will bring the @JeppsonsMalort!

RT @MarkLazerus: You know, you don't really need *both* of those kidneys... http://t.co/wwPoavqDuy

@BrianSandalow boo! You were on point!

@ComradeM @JeppsonsMalort rude! You got the old, traditional formula. There is a newer formula that tastes...more like Mal√∂rt. Shots!

@screaminmonkey @elle_tiburon @AntwonGalante calm down VP. You can be overthrown instantly.

Your statement is bullshit. Just step down. Or come visit us in the US. The reception you get will be great! https://t.co/V7OsN1f6A1

You found him RT @TribLuis Soccer fan converts ambulance into Fire-themed tailgating vehicle: http://t.co/A3BDGcVd4W http://t.co/5ZGqbAK2ej

@ProtectYourNet a very close offside call.

@ProtectYourNet they'll probably go batshit crazy at Azteca against the Impact. Then lose a close game in MTL.

@ProtectYourNet lol. Costa Rican stadiums are just awful to Mexican teams.

@ProtectYourNet they lost in 3-0. But America are now up 5-0. Heh!

@ProtectYourNet Club America is the buzz saw that's gonna dismantle the Impact.

@ProtectYourNet the buzz saw is coming...

RT @AntwonGalante: Holy. Shit. You keep doin' you, CONCACAF.

@imcurry let me know! You know we got you for ticket and you can tailgate with us.

@ProtectYourNet that new jersey isn't that bad.

Shower scenes RT @FuegodemiVida Your day after podcast reminder -  http://t.co/xIOjEPMPvY We had a lot of fun recording this one.

@ComradeM @ProtectYourNet @trevor_brady @MLS they forgot about Toronto when they first invented everything.

RT @TrueMartyParty: @HeyDanGargan congrats brother. You deserve it. So much heart for #cf97 I'm only sad it couldn't be with us.

@ProtectYourNet go to this!

Holy crap @sears. Your associates are just awful. We asked and thought we paid for a certain item. Then we got a totally different item.

RT @DaleJr: You can't ever quit. 

@imcurry @ComradeM @ProtectYourNet @BabiBonez and DiNic's!

So, when @ComradeM @ProtectYourNet @BabiBonez come to town, y'all need to come to @kumascorner with us!

No Jones? Awesome! Seriously! Alan Pulido will be available soon. Young DP status. Or get a 10! #cf97
