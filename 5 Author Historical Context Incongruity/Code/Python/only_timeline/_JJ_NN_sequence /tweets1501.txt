I love Cam Chancellor, but I think the #seahawks need to trade him to the #falcons

If it wasn't for Cassidy, idk what I'd do. She calms me down so much when I'm upset.

If the #falcons go to the super bowl, someone needs to get me tix

Chris complains cuz I dont want him all over me atm. I did just have a baby! I wish guys cud b pregnant jus one day so they can truly see!!

Cassidy actually slept pretty gud last night. Woke up a few times, but I gave her the paci n she was fine.

I have like no belly left now. I think I have already lost all the weight I gained (26 pounds).

Really hate not taking classes this semester, but I've got extra time to spend with the kids

I hate my teeth bein so sensitive after pregnancy.

If u haven't already, u need to watch #idontknowhowshedoesit It's an amazing movie.

If you like/love someone, tell them before it's too late. Quit waiting for them to figure it out! They may actually feel the same way.

Yes I may complain cuz I get hardly any sleep, but you complain you are tired and all you have gotten is sleep!

Welp, Cassidy fell asleep but only ate on one side. And I got cozy and fell asleep with her in my arms. Ohh well. I love her so much :)

When I first saw Cassidy, I almost cried. I was relieved she was finally here, but mainly excited to have another baby girl to call mine!

Dont feel the greatest, but I think it's from lack of sleep.

Thank God I dropped the classes I was taking, cuz for sum reason they changed my mythology prof to the prof I had for literature!

When my back aint hurting anymore I can manage better. This pregnancy just put more strain on me. I'm so glad I have my lil punkin now :)

Chris was sayin he was gna work half days for now, but I'm putn my foot down. He will not work for at least another week til I can manage.

RT @ithinkthatway: Sometimes when I say "It's okay", I really mean "Go fuck yourself".

Pissed cuz I can't take classes this semester. Ohh well. More time with the kids!

I told Chris to sleep a lil bit so he wont grumpy, and he seriously slept till I delivered, then he ate, then slept more.

It's not like he cuda dun too much more, but the only thing Chris did from the time we got to the hospital to the time we left was sleep

Complaining cuz I want you to help keep Cassidy calm for a few mins, when I'm doin everything else. #suckitup

@ThaWonderMann #lt but I change most of them. I'm up with her all the time, so aint no prob. I aint allowed to even lift Caleb n Adyson yet.

@ThaWonderMann I'm tired n busy. I'm completely in charge of Cassidy atm and Chris the other two. He can't breastfeed but can change diapers

#lt so I guess I'm gna have no choice but drop the classes and pay the durn loan payment I can't afford atm :( rele want to take classes!

Dont think I'm gna b able to get my books tmrw. Classes start Monday n I can't rele push it. Mayb if we were allowed to get them earlier!

@haydivers OMG yes I do

@haydivers I'm freezing at this hospital. I need some sleep too. I'm hallucinating cuz I haven't had much sleep at all.

@haydivers thank you ma'am. I'm so glad she decided to come early. I think she kinda looks like me.

More attached to Cassidy than I was the others. Will be exclusively breastfeeding her, so I've got alotta bonding time to come :)

Tired but idc. I'm holdin my munchkin bout to get sum food.

#lt last time I had sleep was Sunday night thru Monday morn.

Dozed off a lil feeding my punkin cuz I got so cozy. But now I can hopefully sleep for two hours #ughh
