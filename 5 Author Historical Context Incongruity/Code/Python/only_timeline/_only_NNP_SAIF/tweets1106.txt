@HeyHeyNRA That prosecutors frequently use 'reasonable' GC laws tools punish lawful actions citizens political purposes 
@HeyHeyNRA That guns also saved lives; every GC law unintended consequences 
@HeyHeyNRA Nope-until willing acknowledge whole picture - impossible talk rationally much less problem solve. 
@HeyHeyNRA Yes, isolated laws quickly overturned - nothing big stuck black codes. 
@HeyHeyNRA The ONLY solution offer attempt take guns away would create several worse problems. #thatisreallyworthless

@HeyHeyNRA In fact, military always congress special little social experiment playground. Always!!! 
@HeyHeyNRA BS. Just like big city cops, military brass get caught political circus. I U.S. Marine, trust I know. 
@HeyHeyNRA No, government cannot award contracts guncos either ... them, many them, simply even try. 
@HeyHeyNRA Perhaps one day become student history aspire be: #rkba #2A #liberty
