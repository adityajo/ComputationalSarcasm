Adam sat living room catching football. He watching 'match day' take mind everything. 
They facing sky, watching cloud bird flew them. "Yeah, subhan Allah," Mariam thought. 
Including studies. That taken gap year, whilst Khaleesah carried studies. 
"Ok fine. I help you, Khaleesah. But I'm friend. I'm really sure though." 
"Look Mariam, know I wanted get married now. There's harm trying, especially dad seems like him." 
She always blunt questions, Khaleesah thought. "Yeah, want put like that. I angry moment" 
"All I wanted make joke pen gave. It wasn't even idea..." He thought.

"maybe I give go." Then thought back said wasn't going marry him. 
She sense humour too. It moment, didn't see funny side it. But much calmer. 
It quite funny all. It prank worked. Her dad funny man. "Maybe I've harsh", whispered herself. 
"I could see upset. Oh daughter. I hate see cry." Khaleesah looked mother's eyes. They twinkled sunlight. 
"It's time pick Ethan school now. I'll back soon". Nabila wore shoes left house. She let deep sigh. 
"She gave me. I don't know why. I think wanted tell something decided give instead. It obvious funny." 
"How get pen?" I asked suspiciously. This pen Khaleesah adored. She used everything. How get it? 
Adam smiled. He started rummaging pocket took pen. "I daughter's pen. Could give back please." 
"Ok, Adam. You permission marry daughter. We would ask too, course. But I'm sure say yes." 
I hadn't imagined getting married time soon. I needed help. Looking Ethan easy. I needed her. 
I happy good guy, I upset would mean Khaleesah would leaving. 
Ahmed serious asked many questions. I knew seemed pleased him. But I wasn't. Did make bad mother? 
Ahmed shook hand sat talk. I went make tea snacks. I took sat them. 
Ahmed decided best let Khaleesah (daughter) know meeting afterwards. Again, I silent this.
