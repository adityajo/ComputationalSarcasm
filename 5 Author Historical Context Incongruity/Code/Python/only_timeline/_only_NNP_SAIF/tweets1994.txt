@Bursteardrum @AlexStedman Mr Nolans best film def "Following" opinion. Definitely worth checking tho No Mr Bale I'm afraid. 
@MKseibati t'other: 
@MKseibati At one end spectrum: 
@MKseibati ...Given Bruce Wayne status mega rich. Important subject sure, I'm sad sounds like didn't take anywh 
@MKseibati Been wondering that! Not seen Mr Nolan said things made think, wow could really interesting... 
@MKseibati Smaller films freedom explore things, less explosion spectacle. Kinda think place 
@MKseibati Good films always subjective thing tho. Just read someone complaining 2001 boring want like Inglorious B. 
@MKseibati I also note avengers least hyped prior release films list! Maybe smaller films ting?
