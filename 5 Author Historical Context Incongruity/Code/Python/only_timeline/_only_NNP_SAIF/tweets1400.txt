@AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith Jim Bowdens trade proposition Jays! If possible.. 1000x yes! 
@AndrewStoeten @npsport #BIRDSALLDAY give one Norris, Hoffman, Sanchez get stud (Cueto =), give? 
@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten @DrewGROF Goins great bench. Get Reyes feet blowouts every 10 days 
@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten keyword = sense. 
@AndrewStoeten why? Who trading for? Howarth doesn't like either? üòè 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten record, I think he'd great LF. Good wheels still strong arm. 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten ya I kinda hoping Travis would too.. Soon 
@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to u rather Carrera &amp; Pillar outfield JB Reyes left Goins short &amp; 1 2? 
@AndrewStoeten @BlueJayHunter nonsense. Buck &amp; Tabby hard head they're miles better crap! 
@AndrewStoeten "I never WAR, I fought 7 them. Har Har Har." "BABIP? Is kids elephant show?" 
@AndrewStoeten @Mentoch misspelled June, Andrew. 
@AndrewStoeten @MikeDiGiovanna don't mean Foo Like symptoms? 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten could Chapman too? I mean, may well.. 
@pbroos1 @AndrewStoeten I got point, I funny. It's early, I forgive 
@pbroos1 @AndrewStoeten poorly portrayed journalist Twitter troll FYI. 
@AndrewStoeten fuck. Off. 
@AndrewStoeten well it's month right? He's gonna bust soon right? Right? JB right? Right? 20 runs/game right? Right? 
@AndrewStoeten I know much like play Doctor.. You think back still fucked? 
@AndrewStoeten it's pretty HorrAwful point I suppose you're right. It get better. 
@AndrewStoeten know tho? Seriously 
@AndrewStoeten no, I'm sure he'll retire point. üòè 
@AndrewStoeten want Lohse? 
@AndrewStoeten Simmons &lt; Simmons. (They're interchangeable) 
@AndrewStoeten he's smart... 
@AndrewStoeten tells best stories broadcast.. I love 
@AndrewStoeten defensible moves sure. I personally would've like see Osuna get chance record third tho.. #MondayQB 
@AndrewStoeten also everyone doesn't keep phone vibrate times. 
I deff get AJ Burnett comparison far tonight! 1 hit 5 walks. @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten make turnip edible butter.. Pick something worse 
Best game recap ever. Ever. Excellent work. Maybe best! *crotch grab @AndrewStoeten* 
@AndrewStoeten @BenBadler f******* epic!! 
@AndrewStoeten it's kind incredible they're leading mlb runs scored best hitters locked in.. 
@AndrewStoeten different note, I heard Gibby MLBnetwork saying Reyes may hit RH'd RHP go DL route.. 
@AndrewStoeten @HumandChuck I get point, it's fair. I don't think care think it's bullshit. 
@AndrewStoeten @HumandChuck hey, I'm trying Gregg Zaun here.. Some things don't change. 
@AndrewStoeten @HumandChuck like not, game played way long long time. 
@jasoncollette @AndrewStoeten clearly not. Or he's bad job 
@AndrewStoeten I think different colour. It pebbles different feel though I think 
@AndrewStoeten pitching solid. Watch get bats going! 
@AndrewStoeten Hoffman hitting 98 regularly?! That makes kinda giddy! 
@AndrewStoeten and, week one, I'm happy Jays end deal! 
@AndrewStoeten I'm willing write entire mess cold piss playing in. Martin, Loup, &amp; Cecil. Clean slate. 
@AndrewStoeten preach! 
@AndrewStoeten I too, asleep went down. It make easier all. Now I'm sad. 
It's good thing AA cranked character offseason, lost buttload talent! @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten that? 
@AndrewStoeten non-news, active volcanoes Montreal. Stay tuned. 
@AndrewStoeten he's hard listen to! 
So that's over, maybe bullpen? @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten thing I could think of. "It means spreading confetti!" So anytime I want I say "white confetti" 
@AndrewStoeten funny story. I wank motion gf last summer 8 year old niece asked meant. So I told 
If @BlueJays give @Orioles anything scraps DD, I may reevaluate fandom. @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten think might actually good awhile? 
@AndrewStoeten gettin old dude 
@AndrewStoeten George Bush 
@AndrewStoeten knew *sheldon cooper voice* 
@AndrewStoeten supposed sarcasm font here? 
@AndrewStoeten pick two.. Any two. 
@AndrewStoeten I gained way respect him! 
@AndrewStoeten wouldn't way! 
@AndrewStoeten I'd love wrong. I'm paraphrasing obviously I've seen quotes many times. 
@AndrewStoeten I can't see much else happening. "There's fit them" "they don't match anyone" "Not dollars" 
@AndrewStoeten meh. AA slow playing. Gonna prey GM's desperation Jan 1 Xmas bills pay! 
@AndrewStoeten clears right up! 
@AndrewStoeten baseballs everyday tsn &amp; sportsnet.!? üôâ 
@AndrewStoeten I'd feel lot better stud back end bullpen. 
@AndrewStoeten reading list makes wish swallowed hard signed Miller Robertson. 
@AndrewStoeten Ugh. Fine Andrew. Let's assume anything, let's wonderful fact based day. üëé 
@AndrewStoeten haha fucker. He never blatantly say anything it. We know THAT. 
@AndrewStoeten sounded way me. We've got limits etc. 
@AndrewStoeten what? 
@AndrewStoeten nothing didn't know safe say he's deff got hard number can't exceed. 
@AndrewStoeten seems odd buy chicago pretty sweet city! Can't blame wanting there. 
@AndrewStoeten missing Martin potentially makes 12 people roster better! If means giving Melky, I'm it! 
@AndrewStoeten I'm perfectly ok swapping Lawrie, Lind, &amp; Melky Donaldson, Martin, &amp; Saunders lineup. I think people 
@AndrewStoeten worth time. 
@AndrewStoeten @Fibnation @Baseball_Jenn also, stuff, always find team willing give chance start. 
@AndrewStoeten ummm what? 
Based current market, prob safe assume Shields gets 17-19/year? @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten hahaha I knew would feel way! 
@AndrewStoeten well could. He's fallin favor Miami I read earlier.. They know little somethin young pitching. 
@AndrewStoeten I know, light payroll crap I say trade dickey put Norris rotation. Roll dice Buerhle 4 youngins 
@AndrewStoeten Ya I suppose.. I like think Norris gonna pan quite nicely! 
@AndrewStoeten either way, Jays can't afford it. 
@AndrewStoeten Heaney = Norris? 
@AndrewStoeten depressing fuck I hope it's way wrong dumps another 25 mil payroll show us. 
@AndrewStoeten Jays went much Lester accord PTS &amp; Bob, &amp; 5 mil less spend?? What gives? #BIRDSALLDAY 
@AndrewStoeten that's exactly amount ideas I have. 
@AndrewStoeten since you're mood, suppose Casey Janssen's price is? 
@AndrewStoeten I forgot Reed! I'd take him.. 
@AndrewStoeten meh. I ain't scurred.. 
@AndrewStoeten @Sandsy02 he's cheap lose? Minimal risk, potential reward? Go it. 
@AndrewStoeten amen watching carve Jays 4 5 times year won't hurt feelings either! 
@AndrewStoeten aww fame! It's beautiful! It's big break! ;) 
@AndrewStoeten what's not? 
@AndrewStoeten Jays equivalent Halladay return system give Philly Hamels? Serious question. 
@AndrewStoeten Gibby said MLB radio they're Melky. Take it's worth.. 
@AndrewStoeten I think it'd fair deal, 12 years control plus big bat two FA's eating Votto's deal. 
Late night thoughts. Norris, Sanchez, EE Cueto, Chapman, &amp; Votto. Do @AndrewStoeten? 
@AndrewStoeten necessarily Norris, I like Strochez bromance. #416 
@AndrewStoeten I'd trade anyone Stroman, Sanchez, &amp; Hutchison get Holland. 
@AndrewStoeten done good man! My social feeds full beautiful mug! 
@AndrewStoeten question, projected profit losses? Or actual losses? 
@AndrewStoeten ah I missed that. Saunders 6.5 doesn't seem quite good somehow. 
@AndrewStoeten see this? 
@AndrewStoeten classify big? Shields Lester Sherzer big? Or McCarthy Liriano big? 
@AndrewStoeten Ogando, Beachy Medlen worth gamble? 
@AndrewStoeten I'd prefer wasn't case. They could worse DH I suppose tho. 
@AndrewStoeten @Joelsherman1 there's Smoak there's fire. #Illseemyselfout 
@AndrewStoeten I'm little surprised Smoak. I thought they'd keep sure. 
@AndrewStoeten Derek Lowe proved work. I'd rather bullpen can't big league rotation. He go back. 
@AndrewStoeten would send AAA instead? 
@AndrewStoeten playoffs proved value dominant relief pitching. If Jays full rotation I fully support pen. 
@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten I hate right now. That 
@AndrewStoeten: Whuuuuuuuuuuuuut? @LottOnBaseball: The rigging grand jury ‚Ä¶ @HumandChuck: Well, awkward 
@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky I idea going work all. They may like Andrew you. 
@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky I may shed tear there.. I think I did.. Maybe it's -22.. Yup it's frozen 
@AndrewStoeten hmm thanks 
@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky touch√©. Windsor Ontario I looking earth works. 
@TheGarfoose @AndrewStoeten @WisersWhisky dirk gotta answer trivia first. Where Wisers brewery located? 
Who's one unmentioned name you'd try acquire AA? Any position. @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten said want guy, taking too. 
@AndrewStoeten I asking worth gamble came guys 
@AndrewStoeten get LFer? 
@AndrewStoeten he's part package including Latos Cueto? 
@AndrewStoeten @DrewGROF poor old Jerry thought guys friends Andrew! "Ya notice I didn't say Stoeten?" "Reason that!" 
@AndrewStoeten everytime I read Boston New York anything I experience equal parts envy &amp; sadness.. Maybe equal. 
@AndrewStoeten reference earlier convo, wouldn't rather sign Lester instead Melky? Take chances get OF trade 4 
@Baseball_Jenn @InItToWinnik @AndrewStoeten @cdsmitty I actually don't problem tantrum. Desire play ok 
@AndrewStoeten first time I've heard this.. I wonder problem children are/were? 
@Baseball_Jenn @AndrewStoeten @jefflewis21 @BennisSnet guys think maybe Gibbons little hands off? 
@AndrewStoeten Curt suspended? Otherwise theory holds water 
@AndrewStoeten Bob still whipping Lester horse... Man I ever hope he's right! 
@AndrewStoeten think Jay Bruce would good fit Churrono? 
@AndrewStoeten @CrawfordChrisV makes crazy people say Toe Ron Toe 
@AndrewStoeten @russellmartin55 I thought pronounced "The 6"? 
@AndrewStoeten good fantasy.. I'll believe true it's not. 
@AndrewStoeten I like much! I watching PTS said afternoon I got bit chub... 
@AndrewStoeten whattya make last You feel there's truth that? 
@AndrewStoeten @Wilnerness590 shameless self promotion.. I dig it! 
Congrats @AndrewStoeten! 
@AndrewStoeten bout chance #Raps acquire Kobe Landry Fields.. Actually, that's likely 
@AndrewStoeten hard believe.. That said, weren't Lind away playoffs anyway. 
@AndrewStoeten @Bluejayburger payroll spiking?? Pleaaaassseee 
@AndrewStoeten @WongSN590 @outsidethenba naw, two years there'll 6' 9" guy small forward spot.. My fav snack! KD 
@AndrewStoeten buggy eyed useless twat nobody takes seriously? Oh, already? Mission accomplished 
@drunkjaysfans @AndrewStoeten I allow dumb offseason fantasy every year payroll go 170mil so! #HelloMax 
@Wilnerness590 @AndrewStoeten @MattGelb what??! This worst possible news! Springtraining never same! Pastry baskets üòû 
How hell Pete Rose given second chance yet? Insanity @AndrewStoeten @SNETCampbell @bnicholsonsmith 
@AndrewStoeten I didn't think so. Buck &amp; Pat subtly suggesting tonight... 
Would pay Morrow 10 mil pitch back bullpen next year? @AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith @BKennedyStar 
@AndrewStoeten true.. Very true 
@peteanderson @AndrewStoeten @james_in_to FA, maybe JJ Hardy. Or Adeiny Hechavaria.... 
@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to ya, RF. Move Melky RF, Reyes LF. 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten left field. Melky play right. JB play 3rd. Lawrie 2nd. 
@AndrewStoeten @ddale8 haha smoked meat scrambled eggs tho... Man.. So good! 
@AndrewStoeten damn. I looking forward thoughts call ups. 
Are typing fingers little nubs @AndrewStoeten? 
@AndrewStoeten 23-6 90 wins! We got this.... 
@AndrewStoeten true. 
@AndrewStoeten devils advocate; say San Fran offered Madison Bamgardner..? Do ya? 
@AndrewStoeten saying I think it's good idea.. 
@TonyRasmusIV @AndrewStoeten @james_in_to @based_ball lower third strike zone doesn't exist he's back 
How hell Darvish clear waivers contract? @AndrewStoeten 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten responses nonsense surprisingly logical! ie: nobody agreed him. 
@AndrewStoeten besides able resume life? None 
@AndrewStoeten shits cray! 
How's mentions boys? üòè @AndrewStoeten @ShiDavidi @gregorMLB @RGriffinStar 
There's chance Hamels made far Jays waiver wire right @AndrewStoeten? Just I remove brain 
@AndrewStoeten I think there's team pay Jays want to. 
Not something didn't know already safe bet Rasmus goner eh? @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten unless it's plastic fork.. Then it's fingers 
@AndrewStoeten @rwesthead I thought really liked KIK 
Great DJF post morning @AndrewStoeten! Let's hope Cole Hamels hits waiver wire Jays claim make deal! 
Do think August trade real possibility? @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten I meant specifically Toronto. Just add perspective.. Know I'm sayin? 
@AndrewStoeten I would kill know asking price Lester, Price, etc. 
So David Price went Franklin &amp; Smyly? That's it? @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten I don't think it'll move defines season. 
@AndrewStoeten: Really sucks season ended Jays blown Boston week, eh? 
Do think Hellickson's stupid slow pace makes hitters anxious changeup effective? @AndrewStoeten would drive nuts! 
@AndrewStoeten Jim Bowden says Nolin &amp; Lugo gets Headley SD. Would you? &amp; agree? 
@AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten: Like fucking clockwork: Jays go down, venting fools start dumping angst Twitter would make 17-year-old live‚Ä¶ 
@AndrewStoeten: Here's another game would really fucking extra great Jays come back idiots. Everywhere‚Ä¶ 
@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to who? First base ump last night? 
@AndrewStoeten @kman9924 challenge umpire removed game? Have standby ump? 
@AndrewStoeten that's amazing part, they're alive! Don't folks see UFO's get butt probed whatnot? 
@gregorMLB @james_in_to @HumandChuck @AndrewStoeten attempt make fun, who's first position player pitch #Jays? 
@AndrewStoeten play nostraStoeten moment predict move, any, #Jays make deadline. #beasport 
@AndrewStoeten resume immediately 
@AndrewStoeten consistent. Bullshit. But consistent. 
@AndrewStoeten old favorite old team putting ass whoopin Lebron &amp; company! It's beautiful 
@AndrewStoeten better served full year AA? 
@AndrewStoeten fan this? You think they're trying push see snag second half rotation spot? 
@AndrewStoeten I turned '95 also.. Once #Raps beat bulls Dome I knew made right choice.. 
@AndrewStoeten I grew Windsor.. Hating Detroit teams.. The pistons broke bulls loving heart years there.. 
@AndrewStoeten speed &amp; bunting! 
@AndrewStoeten shut Jamie Campbell Gregg Zaun!! 
Buck always seems surprised managers don't take suggestions booth.. @AndrewStoeten 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten would say, #TeamFoDinsety 
@AndrewStoeten @jeffperera games fucking yet! FFS 
@AndrewStoeten walking struggling Mauer face The Hammer seems like risky strategy 
@AndrewStoeten think? I dunno buddy.. 
@sportslogosnet @AndrewStoeten still it, last year anyway.. Ppl get excited brains don't work 
@AndrewStoeten @devil_fingers never applicable 
@AndrewStoeten better.. It's BR video knows know... I know you're huge fan them! ;) 
@AndrewStoeten @elliottbaseball posted link scouting reports one videos mentioned that.. 
@AndrewStoeten also Boras client.. A 2 1 
@AndrewStoeten @Wilnerness590 Loup get hold, save, &amp; win game! 
@AndrewStoeten nope, doesn't seem way me? 
@AndrewStoeten fuck shit huh?? Dude totally runs gas 80 pitches seems like 
@AndrewStoeten prefer "hilarious" opposed dumb whatevs 
@AndrewStoeten @Hoodlum04 I agree Andrew. At point Gose greater value trade IMO 
@Hoodlum04 @AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith @ShiDavidi I don't necessarily disagree you're going get Hamels Colby. 
@Hoodlum04 @AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith @ShiDavidi he's FA.. Value isn't 
@Hoodlum04 @AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith @ShiDavidi haha fantasize like it... 
Say Friedman loses mind deals Price Toronto.. What would cost? @AndrewStoeten @bnicholsonsmith @ShiDavidi 
@AndrewStoeten @BlueJaysPlus awesome!! I'd like see 5 6 series... 
Hey guess @AndrewStoeten?? Today's another "statement" game!! Yayyy 
@AndrewStoeten @BKennedyStar @GuzmansJhercurl @coolhead2010 hahaha I never agreed. Just pointing coming 
@coolhead2010 @AndrewStoeten @BKennedyStar @GuzmansJhercurl poor buck.. All wants Stroman, Sanchez, &amp; Nolin rotation.... 
@AndrewStoeten @BKennedyStar @GuzmansJhercurl @coolhead2010 Buck said like 5 times today's broadcast..... 
@AndrewStoeten imagine minute #Jays RH version Lind?? #wowza 
How mentions looking @AndrewStoeten? Haha garbage team can't win 140 games... Pffft 
@AndrewStoeten @SNBarryDavis Andrew's drinking schedule going way wack! Bright side, game tweets better! 
@AndrewStoeten @_DaveAnthony Mexican town. 
@AndrewStoeten haha yes! I knew I heard 
@AndrewStoeten: Fuck, Edwin good hitter. 
@AndrewStoeten per earlier convo, I looked online Analytics courses via Northwestern U.. Care join me? Front office pals? 
@AndrewStoeten I imagine could said every team. Also, I think club Sanchez ahead Drabek.. 
Sooo @AndrewStoeten, replaces Happ rotation now? Nolin? 
@AndrewStoeten need go MIT get jobs? 
@AndrewStoeten don't apply job? Whip fuckers shape! 
@AndrewStoeten know fact? And so? #seriousquestion 
@AndrewStoeten ads make wanna slit wrists 
@AndrewStoeten fuck it. Extend too! #extendeverybody 
@AndrewStoeten serious question: who's best tv guys? apart Scully who's another planet awesome ppl hang out.. 
@AndrewStoeten promise.. 
@AndrewStoeten thanks dawg! 
@AndrewStoeten @DrewGROF I've sleeping nightshift.. Jose Reyes?? Please inform! 
@AndrewStoeten play lefties.. I don't know man.. PH options.. Something resembling friggin bench.. 
@AndrewStoeten you're right. Are saying bury never give another chance? Like shit dude. Just saying he's hot "might" hit 
@AndrewStoeten true, tell he's least sucking fat dicks might bit confidence tho.. 
@AndrewStoeten Jenkins.. Fine. Diaz? Really? Pillar maybe? No? We wouldn't guy batting .500 right side.. Smh 
@AndrewStoeten Amen that! #highfive #buttslap 
@AndrewStoeten you're saying lots things make smile right now. trying seduce Stoeten? Looking dinner date? 
@AndrewStoeten hmm listening #Jaystalk again? 
@AndrewStoeten over/under 3. Remaining starts Happ. 
@AndrewStoeten #firegibbons running score.. Very unsportsmanlike 
@AndrewStoeten I like Jays hit homers! 
@AndrewStoeten @DrewGROF what's take "retirement tour" crap last year year 42 &amp; 2? 
@AndrewStoeten: Favourited times infinity. @trapunski KG worst. 
@AndrewStoeten predictions gets DFA'd Stroman? 
@AndrewStoeten that's fair man. I won't argue that's he's moron. His voice sends chills spine, good ones! 
@AndrewStoeten harder digest, Zaun Cox? #Coxhurtsmybrain 
@BombKengartner @AndrewStoeten @Hope_Smoke I understand that. He correct. Whether it's attributed AA &amp; staff another matter. 
@AndrewStoeten fair enough.. 
@AndrewStoeten I'm privy excuse ignorance, scouting department new since AA took no? 
@BombKengartner @AndrewStoeten @Hope_Smoke right minor league system tho. Not many everyday players coming it. 
@AndrewStoeten I don't like you're reasonable right time. üòè 
@AndrewStoeten Sooo, they're better before. Bullpen needed addressed wasn't. Short bench still.. 
I don't know addressed already, #Jays moves zip address four long men, nothing move! @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten feel Andrew? 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten I hope so! It would amaze balls! 
@AndrewStoeten obviously. But they're position put guys rotation, they're likely screwed anyway. 
@AndrewStoeten I get that. To tho Happ = Romero. Rogers = Jenkins. I don't want see 10 games .500 something. 
@AndrewStoeten agree disagree. 
@AndrewStoeten I get that. Is knee jerk get rid Rogers &amp; Happ tho really? They track records. They're great. 
@AndrewStoeten I time. If I wasn't massive fan, basically entire life, I wouldn't bother crap. 
@AndrewStoeten "potentially" better options Buffalo? 
@AndrewStoeten You're entitled opinion. Does frustrate hoard long men hope become something 
@AndrewStoeten I know walks look like tho. Is wrong I want guy seems ready shot? 
@AndrewStoeten I don't. I'm making educated guess based numbers I saw Spring Training. 
@AndrewStoeten IMO looks ready deserves shot. McGowan openly admitting can't get five innings. 
@AndrewStoeten ahh perspective... I still wanna see Stroman tho! 
@clabberty12 @AndrewStoeten @TaoofStieb difference is, Buerhle's crap outlier. Morrow's 2012 outlier here. 
@AndrewStoeten like they're irreplaceable? That's insane. What would call it? 
@AndrewStoeten seeing I'm missing something here? Besides 56 &amp; 36 obviously. And holding onto Rogers, Happ &amp; Redmond 
@AndrewStoeten @TaoofStieb maybe insane. I know it's insane attempt "contend" current collection arms. 
@AndrewStoeten @TaoofStieb waiting fools gold eggs hatch see rotten are? 
@AndrewStoeten @TaoofStieb I'm tired watching crap hearing crap. Do something shake shit up! 
@AndrewStoeten @TaoofStieb crazy? Actually able throw strike pen, bad idea. 
@AndrewStoeten @TOforsh I sadly believe right now. 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten k cool man, thanks! 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten guaranteed shade regardless roof status? 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten I'm buying tickets games summer. I'm bringing baby first time. What's best bet 
@AndrewStoeten humor me.. Send Dustin back pen. Call Stroman.. Get rid two 3 long men.. Bring another bench bat.. #ideal 
@AndrewStoeten else supposed let McGowan know shitty feel coughing big lead? 
@AndrewStoeten they're allowed voice displeasure. Pretty epic display shittyness. 
@AndrewStoeten Dustin fields ball like Dickey, he's still there. 
@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to although it's terrible error judgement, I sometimes read comments... People eat shit up! #Crack 
@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to Gibbons pulls 4 runs scored, ppl would too.. Tough spot. Pitch better Dick 
@AndrewStoeten @james_in_to oh I agree you. Realistically, long leash? 15 starts? 
@james_in_to @AndrewStoeten doesn't, Dickey pisses moans wike wittle baby 
@AndrewStoeten hopefully it's late.. 
If Dickey pitches well today, ya think he'll want mlb schedule start November roof open games? @AndrewStoeten 
@drunkjaysfans damn job prohibits drunk day game.. They respect tradition @AndrewStoeten 
@AndrewStoeten I would bet back doesn't like weather.. I hope I'm wrong 
@AndrewStoeten predict outcome Muni's atbat. Go 
@AndrewStoeten say Plouffe Loup ten times fast 
@AndrewStoeten wouldn't cool stopped swinging fastballs heads started swinging strikes? 
@AndrewStoeten offense offensive. #dadjokes 
@AndrewStoeten hahahahhahaha first one still favorite! The look face kills me! 
@AndrewStoeten Boni's ChiTown shirt game point! 
@AndrewStoeten given available options minors, would choice.. If Dan Johnson right handed I'd take him.. 
@AndrewStoeten 3 long men less good. A real bench would amaze-balls! 
@drunkjaysfans @AndrewStoeten would rather Rogers, Redmond Happ bullpen Gose bench?
