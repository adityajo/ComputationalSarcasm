So I guess Russel Martin knew re-signing New York, eh? After Cutch, he's MVP 
@digitalkid2112 You get 10, you're Babe Ruth air....and won't win MVP. Stupid baseball people. 
Mike Trout isn't going win MVP (again) it's going stupid (again). Fangraphs 10.0 (!) WAR. Next best MLB 7.6 
When Joe Mauer won MVP 2009, caught 109 games (played 138). Molina easily clear games caught, 101 
@MeyersMusings If I'm using pro-Yadi bias, I'd say honestly Kershaw MVP Cy 
Cardinals 6-1 since Yadier Molina returned. He may win MVP, may valuable player team 
Cano 200 home runs and, believe it, didn't hustle around bases them! 
Yankee broadcast crediting Soriano "protecting" Cano lineup Cano's home run. 
27 catchers passed balls, 27 allowed total wild pitches. Oh, he's leading NL hitting. #MVP 
@HeardOnMLBT: "Jason Grilli MVP." - Bill Ripkin 
Yadier Molina, NL MVP, hitting .365/.406/.514 
Michael Kay criticizing Robinson Cano batting 2 spot. Cano came today hitting .318/.384/.621 
Buster Olney saying Cano "went Jay-Z" made chuckle. 
Guessing complaints Cano hitting 2nd cease 
I can't get used preview Jackie Robinson movie using Jay-Z background. Hard find opposite figure 
REPORT: Robbie Cano covered bubble wrap remainder spring 
@conorglassey: Is better day baseball birthdays Jan. 31? Jackie Robinson, Ernie Banks &amp; Nolan Ryan! 
How JJ Watt even part MVP conversations? 
On radio MNF broadcast, Jim Gray asks Tom Brady he'd vote MVP. You'll NEVER believe answer..."next 2 weeks decide it"
