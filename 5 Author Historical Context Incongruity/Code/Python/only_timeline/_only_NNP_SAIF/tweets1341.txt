@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni it's unfortunately. I think it's something that's gonna talking point year nothing else! 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni I understand teams playing loads DR players, big picture needs looking 
@thetankerking I'd need one first lol 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni fair I think we've lucky link worth lot DR, that's added benefit. 
@jamescunni @rhino_paulw end day need payers turnstiles compete, DR helps fronts. If used properly 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni fingers crossed I think we've got good bunch players &amp; duel reg adds that. 
@thetankerking posh maybe slightly expensive taste! I work club match day cashing turnstiles among things 
@jamescunni @rhino_paulw I think we've got little faith abilities well. Marchy looked good bit I saw. 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni I impressed defence second half, least there's definitely something build on. 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni I saw looked ok, I don't think change ref helped either. We need cutting edge. 
@thetankerking depends I like bubbles lol. We got beat 14 4. I saw second half though. 
@jamescunni oh dear, might watch video later. Just hope it's good performance next week, I'm sure boys it.

@thetankerking would good plan unfortunately I hate whiskey! 
@nathanmckie1 I 
@ruthiebabes13 really could, I'll mention council, I'll soon x 
@thetankerking haha I'm quite generous! 
@Rhino_PaulW pretty obvious everyone.... Apart officials is. It's surprising players get frustrated. 
@nigelchadtaylor haha I'll let tell that!! Knowing heels real possibility! Although we're standing I'm sure 
@nigelchadtaylor I might see then. You'll look Scott Melbourne shirt ;) 
Think I'll seeing lava shells sleep amount massage I've done week!! So glad it's finally weekend. 
@willythehawk I suppose gets us talked nothing else. No things bad publicity &amp; that. Barry knows he's doing. 
@willythehawk I looking forward it, good game. I really can't believe melodramatic people duel reg!! 
@jamescunni I think tries controversial &amp; ends sounding bit idiot. 
@jamescunni wouldn't bad ran time. But I don't blame you, really terrible. 
Any contractors tell acceptable timescale start chasing payment invoicing? Turns I'm patient!! 
@TheGownRoom let know hear anything hun, I better get back work lol xx 
@TheGownRoom spoken yet? I think least offer refund &amp; replacement! Xx 
@TheGownRoom I'd seriously kick that!! It's shocking customer service. I've text back hun xx 
@TheGownRoom that's terrible!! I hope Adam gets money back, there's excuse delivering dead flowers!! xx 
Getting really fed pretty arrogant opinions duel reg. At end day I'd prefer hunslet &amp; yorks etc survive 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni @gazevans03 people see want I agree there's lot link field stuff. 
@jamescunni @rhino_paulw @gazevans03 tbh I wouldn't don't know they'll get bored. I'd rather viable business &amp; helps.. 
@Rhino_PaulW @jamescunni @gazevans03 I agree wholeheartedly, end day need playing champs rugby next year! 
@GazEvans03 @jamescunni that's always good thing! It'll make interesting season nothing else! 
@ruthiebabes13 haha do! I'll 5-30, I'm massage clinic make missing week! 
@GazEvans03 @jamescunni least it's got us publicity nothing else. I can't remember club ever talked much 
@ruthiebabes13 lol you? Cheeky? Never ;) I hope it's worth wait!! 
@GazEvans03 @jamescunni tbh I'm happier we've done anyway, may taken experienced player we're still Hunslet. 
@ruthiebabes13 haha know anyone Cas pester you? 
@ruthiebabes13 get top weller? X 
@OutbackOrganics launching? I'm interested taking new waxing products. 
It really amaze people business! Waiting week respond urgent email good form üò°üò°üò° 
@billiejohn88 haha I don't know mean!!!!

@ruthiebabes13 sounds familiar! Roll next week, get better 
@ruthiebabes13 sounds like good plan! Today definitely good day watching rugby. How game? X 
@Dam64Worden thanks m62 bit grim!! I'm sure there'll plenty Duel reg banter add atmosphere ;) 
@ruthiebabes13 I'll fill gory details next week! Have good day tomorrow x 
@ruthiebabes13 ha hope he's still got it! i'll fill training disaster next week then! i'll tomorrow, can't wait 
@ruthiebabes13 haha god loves trier Ruthie!! Are dewsbury game? Xx 
@NiamhWil really are, I'm tempted mute button!!! 
@jamescunni I think it's partly done bigger scale first team players. That &amp; won't whipping boys year! 
@GavWilson touch√©, I don't see point press release. But could hunslet fan talking!! 
@jamescunni we're light weight compared I think Moore useful. The lueluai issue beyond r control 
@jamescunni tbh DR used differently thought I think people melodramatic. The end nigh lol 
@rhinocjb @GavWilson I think mainly need someone realise business &amp; needs run like one. 
@rhinocjb @gavwilson I'm sure done clear objective mind &amp; rules already changed once. 
@rhinocjb @gavwilson maybe so, it'll interesting see develops season. As I think club link ups valuable asset. 
@rhinocjb @gavwilson I've said long time something needs looking SL down, link SL, champs &amp; amateur teams 
@Williams_Darren haha I bet, least we've got people talking!! 
@rhinocjb @gavwilson I think it's something needs reviewing &amp; it's difficult goalposts keep getting moved u20s etc. 
@GavWilson thats thing don't turn super league level prop But I agree player pathways &amp; youth development 
@GavWilson I'll admit reservations side it, I don't see us feeder club. It's beneficial link far 
@garethwalker13 @hunslethawksrl I think ideas good one I think clubs got carried away. I'm happy link far 
Lack sleep I kicking in, think early night order!! 
@ruthiebabes13 did, really good performance. Glad good time though hun. X 
@ruthiebabes13 I'm guessing good one! 
@0akesy3 I'll make sure I'm early, I think I've got queue! 
@Jayne_Lizzie you're one, I don't get need padding &amp; crash helmets play poor version rugby either? 
@Rhino_PaulW they've made art form, I'm pleased deal anyway 
@Rhino_PaulW I thought tbh, like anything else Rfl seem move goal posts 
@Rhino_PaulW probably save paper work, I don't think it's fair players champs club. 
@ally_2010 goes without saying!! I think may struck potential gold mine ;) x 
@Rhino_PaulW definitely &amp; field. Although I don't agree registering whole squad, kinda defeats object
