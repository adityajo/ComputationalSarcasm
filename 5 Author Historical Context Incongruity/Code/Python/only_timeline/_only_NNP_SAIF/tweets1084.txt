I think #Toronto wait 10 years tear #GardinerEast 1)driverless cars&amp;trucks could radically change transport needs 
@ButterworthArch My highline proposal: pedestrian bridge Toronto Islands. Would actually dip inches Lake Ontario places. 
@ButterworthArch Toronto's 'high-line' Hwy 9! 
@donnelly_b I look Gardiner Toronto's "mountain." A great place view city 
Interesting: The 1% want #GardinerEast down; 99% want? 
@donnelly_b #GardinerEast sexy: Toronto's monument alluring thrill automobile. Long may live! 
@TorontoStar typical Toronto politics. Build subway it's needed: The Beach Mimico via King Street.

In dream govt military official shouting warning: interest rates rise 15%. Meanwhile Toronto breaking up... 
I woke nightmare: end world Toronto style. A broken L Tower &amp; Ice condos floating towards I snapped 
Contrarian opinion: everytime Mattamy buys something big Toronto real estate market crashes. 
@NimbyTect: What #Toronto style? 
Death cross confirmed #TSX means Toronto real estate market gonna turn bearish February 2015. You heard hear first. 
Everyone says public spaces great. No. I think private space--bed--is best space Toronto right now. G'nite 
@s_roddick @TorontoStar privileged elites intimidated douchebags common folks like myself? 
@CBCToronto I bet so-called "terrorist" attack. Inside job? 
Toronto's best burger actually 905: Zet's rock'n. 
Is Doug Ford dumbest asshole Toronto? Rob looks like genius comparison. 
@TorontoStar everyone I werk with. 
@SusanPigg @TorontoStar What brat. 
@alexbozikovic @ramikozman The key factor is, deets must right. Minimalism wrong here. I want New Berlin Toronto-style here! 
Could every single condo tower goes Toronto really soul-sucking sbux outlet disguise?

One time fave Toronto Condos aA's Glas Condominiums--the podium esp brilliant: modern materials reflecting old traditions 
For reason dog likes Toronto-style bagels. Which gave idea: bagels dogs. 
Promoted tweets Vancouver House? Kinda makes nervous re: viability. I think would sell better Toronto. 
@benmyers29 Prediction: When Jays win world series next time, Toronto midst housing crash. 
@iSlutsky @311Toronto 2nd idea: racoon poison stickers place inside lids. Only racoons would die &amp; I'd make $ change 
@iSlutsky @311Toronto idea: racoon poison built lids ... racoons would die, right? 
@Urban_Toronto How possible? It's dreary grey "window wall shame" - I trademark phrase? 
@TorontoStar Poutine flavoured chips would big hit. 
What selfie charrette? NimbyTect designs future #junctionTo via @Urban_Toronto 
@junctionTO @RAW_TO What think would fit better here? Any recent Toronto buildings come mind? 
@junctionTO It's awful. @RAW_TO one Toronto's best architecture firms. It could much worse. Expect midrises area 
@AshtonPearson Average pay cheque earner Toronto better paying 25% down, home 3-4X earnings. 
@tara_deschamps @TorontoStar Why run parades &amp; marathons along scenic residential streets? eg Rosedale, Forest Hill, Annex etc 
When Toronto Star Globe Mail merge one daily printed edition? The Star Globe? 
@Jawad_Rathore Have ever gone Red Hook? It's Toronto-feel'n 'hood NYC imo. 
@TOCondoNews Toronto? I different ideas "ideal living" ppl. eg: I would rather live houseboat condo 
@TOCondoNews Hard-working ppl making average Toronto salary without benefit inheritance money. 
@TOCondoNews We, real ppl Toronto don't want incentives, want affordable sustainable development. I afford $150k condo. 
@ProjectEND I seen urbanity suburban proposals Northern Europe 90% Toronto condo developments.... 
@ProjectEND Other aA's Humbertown proposal, I yet see Toronto firm match Port Credit's urbanity past 20 years. 
Most "normies" day jobs idea awesome Toronto 6-7am 98% city sidewalks/streets empty. 
If you're really bored real estate obsessed I've updated bunch sites via @Urban_Toronto 
Interesting: Volume weekly $INDU steadily declining past years. Is 2014 another market top? 
I think I prefer Toronto 6am. I entire city then. 
@Urban_Toronto How call TFA project day? It's rubbish 
@TorontoStar Rob Ford TV answer. 
Seriously, every single detached home Toronto worth $1 million? How many $250k income earners here? 
What happens Waterfront #Toronto WaveDecks inspire NimbyTect? Time Wave Condos:

So Chinese build 125 mile tunnel across Bering Strait yet Toronto can't even build tunnel island airport? 
When I run Mayor Toronto tagline "The Amish Mayor" 
@DonSmith_ca @shawnmicallef @TorontoStar So many front yards downtown--including Junction etc--are really SUV/luxury car parking lots 
@shawnmicallef @Spacing @TorontoStar eg: The Annex merely suburb Etobicoke. It's ECC kids come play 
@TalkCondo @BuzzBuzzHome @AndrewLaFleur @SavelSells know W comes Toronto it's officially passé. 1/2 
@BradJLamb @robcarrick @globeandmail I could 5 homes Hamilton price one Toronto. A good investment, right? ;)

Question: Why Toronto become less affordable condo supply increases? (compare average 1998 prices today example) 
@RenderPornStar: Interesting: Could rise housing prices lead increase "rentier" class Toronto? 
@DSGcondos @Urban_Toronto many units, sq footage aA? 
Interesting every 5 years Annex changes ... seems going mid-range dumpster dive. 
@BenRabidoux Looks like Toronto Mike$$$ gonna puke / @Remaxcondosplus @BrianPersaud 
@RenderPornStar: UnbiaAsed what?! Theatre Park &amp; Peter Street Condos Toronto's 2014 "couple year" :-D 
Food trucks bull shit. They pollute, serve food unhygienic kitchens make Toronto's urban elite look like hypocrites. #TOpoli 
@SavelSells @Urban_Toronto My April Fools joke: 
Interesting developers essentially saying Toronto's land overpriced. So keep bashing #condoBBL talk? lolz 
Chow's right: Toronto needs buses! 
@Urban_Toronto won't target bankrupt then? 
@UrbanPolicyPlnr @symmetrydevelop @BrianPersaud neither. I say Lake Shore/Mimico/New Toronto/Long Branch they're moving to. 
I like Etobicoke. It Toronto's hipsters (who don't want move Hamilton) moving to--cheaper rent #1 reason 
@RenderPornStar: Is guy Toronto's next mayor?! #TOpoli

Ford Nation bores me. I suggest bros talk sex, drugs, sports rock'n roll, boring Toronto politics. 
Yes, I really think Toronto needs brown-clad buildings. Love 2 Spadina &amp; Walmer Rd.:-) 
I wonder Toronto's best architects wear working? I tend work best underwear #TMI 
Do Toronto architects live modern apartment buildings? Maybe that's I inspired old architecture...? 
@RenderPornStar: Condo Schmooze: Futura Condos launch Spring 2014 #Toronto ?! Bauhaus inspired perhaps? 
@Aidanist @jen_keesmaat I'm suggesting experiment frontier-style speculation free regulation may Toronto needs 
@Aidanist @jen_keesmaat Yes: What created urban planner-free zone Toronto experiment? Eg Dufferin Street 
Nothing makes happier long walk Toronto snowstorm checking new &amp; old housing stock:-)

@realpigasus My joke: Ford Nation reads sports section, front &amp; back covers Left reads rest re: Toronto Sun 
@NicoleVanStone I guess I'm priced Toronto market ... forever. I could afford $500/month mortgage payments. 
Pretend I'm architect. What style would I @Urban_Toronto ?

@JShamess really. Canada plenty space. eg: Toronto enough parking lots fit 5 million ppl 4s height limit! 
@JShamess I mean Toronto north 401 could redeveloped way. 
@JShamess What I think Toronto 905 needs: Brooklyn/Mtl-style walkups, rentals owner occupied flats. 4 storey height limit 
@JShamess @AndrewLaFleur @Urbanation @Morguard @RockDala Interesting see many apt landlords furiously renovating buildings...1/2 
@WalkToronto @401Richmond @TCDSB Stay tuned @NimbyTect highrise condo vision coming 401 Richmond sometime

I agree Rob Ford: The Toronto Star tabloid newspaper. Nothing wrong ... it's G&amp;M. 
Toronto elitists: 905 suburban sprawl consists mostly vulgar EIFS &amp; faux stone monstrosities fauxstoric bullshit icing top 
Toronto elitists: 905 suburban sprawl (wider newer roads &amp; homes) continues despite protestations. From Erin Acton Brampton 
My new fave hangout Toronto: #Fullstop 
Rob Ford's life doesn't interest me. Translation: I won't paying Toronto Star. 
@RenderPornStar: Snapped: Volta Lofts Annette Street near Runnymede #Toronto topped out: 
When Toronto developers stop pandering one cultural group create common modern "Toronto aesthetic?" 
@AndrewCotz @AndrewLaFleur @Urban_Toronto maybe. But I know price ALWAYS follows volume. 
@AndrewCotz @AndrewLaFleur On @Urban_Toronto years ago I stated Aura, Trump etc topped would go market.
