@SportsRadioWIP @robellissports Brady greatest QB time. Montana right #2. But Brady clear cut #1 IMO. 
@HockeyyInsiderr Not exactly true. They countered Lecavalier instead Simmonds + Schenn, Coburn, pick 17 + more. Too much end 
@Aportzline Got great cb play opposite Haden, horrible bills teams first next year could get good QB next pick. 
@SportsCenter looks like QB's matching almost exactly. Luck ahead amount throws, obviously. 
@D_LEED get him! Better QB increases value. They'll throw lot. Resurgent year coming Fitzgerald. 
@benmaller yeah, paying potential future. He's young QB. That's beginning. 
@AnthonyMingioni Took work trade deadline. Thinking it, silly that. What I doing. My priorities whack. 
Wow! Too harsh @McDad62910: @Buster_ESPN oh really? His best season 2012 2010 even won 11 games. You're idiot 
Of course. That shouldn't even questioned. We're witnessing best QB time.RT @espn: Should Tom Brady win year's MVP award? 
Agreed. He shouldn't right away. @BuzzOnBroad: Not smart throw Maclin right away 
Agreed. Too much hype rook hasn't played one snap regular season yet. @seanc283: rookie QB. #Sarcasm #EaglesFans 
Thinking thing. Weird. @seanc283: Why include player's addresses police report?
