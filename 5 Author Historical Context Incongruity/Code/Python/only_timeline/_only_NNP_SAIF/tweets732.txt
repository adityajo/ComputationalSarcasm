@Judson1360 I've traded another badge honor. #GoPadres 
@Judson1360 Once Sox finally won bandwaggoners came out, wasn't same. Loved title different. 
@Judson1360 I agree. As Red Sox fan growing Yankee territory, I'd see another fan Sox fan, know shared (sad) pride. 
@SDSUChristian @annieheilbrunn It looks like #Drake me! 
@annieheilbrunn Status update: 
@kevin_charity Yeah, tonight.

@vosdscott (2/2) With rezoning nightmare. Ever see scenario 75 acres end SDSU/MLS smaller stadium built?

@obxleatherman: Kris Bryant tied Tony Gwynn career games three strikeouts. 
@jeffdotseth FYI.. Carson site: 168 acres, Qualcomm site: 166 acres 
@Rossible Exactly. PSL's need discussed I think they'll factor funding new stadium one piece puzzle. 
@Rossible Neither. The "increased value" mention PSL itself. Felt like infomercial PSL's &amp; new stadium amenities. 
@NoSleeves4You @GeoffGrammer It's important SDSU's credibility &amp; overall success MWC UNLV &amp; UNM turn programs around. 
@sdjeremiah @boltfanindenver @annieheilbrunn Personally, stigma associated Raider organization would much overcome. 
@therealshirk15 All Chargers fans varying degrees. Honestly, that's demographic need learn from. Diehards go regardless. 
@sdjeremiah @boltfanindenver @annieheilbrunn Got one. Although group disagreed several points, nobody would support Raiders. 
@Judson1360 Well said buddy! #Respect 
@RallyPlantain @GhostofRAK The Padres aren't last FU San Diego Carson Chargers changing colors brown &amp; gold 
@GhostofRAK No. Market research already shown #BringBackTheBrown movement vocal minority fan base.

@annieheilbrunn Yes explained it's easy open PSL's wallet still closed. #StadiumFocusGroup 
@annieheilbrunn Just hypothetical scenarios. "Would willing pay $2,500 PSL end-zone seats? $1,500?" Etc. #StadiumFocusGroup 
@sdjeremiah @annieheilbrunn I think two groups scheduled tonight well. 
@Rossible They I think room PSL's coming in. #StadiumFocusGroup 
@StripeShow Hypotheticals given based sections. Other stadiums used compare. SD's PSL examples low end spectrum. 
Like survey, #StadiumFocusGroup concentrated PSL's. Only 2 11 said wouldn't purchase PSL. (I 1 2) 
Attendees spent half today's Chargers #StadiumFocusGroup praising @Padres fan experience &amp; marketing. @WaynePartello 
@GhostofRAK "That's works."

@DavidIngold Thanks clarification. 
@gpettooh @tpowell619 @EastCountyDave @SaveOurBolts Don't think NFL would approve relocation proposal presented public. 
@EastCountyDave @gpettooh @SaveOurBolts That said, I'm well versed specifics. Can't see scenario happens '15. 
@gpettooh @EastCountyDave @SaveOurBolts They'd convince NFL they've exhausted efforts. There's also huge relocation fee. 
@gpettooh @EastCountyDave @SaveOurBolts I believe, owners approve move, they'd pay lease penalty. 
@DavidIngold A full unit ALL First Four teams, win lose? Boise State lost MWC still get unit split $1.6M? 
@GeoffGrammer MW desperate wins. Not earn conference respect also earn $1.6M.

@NoID_Rich @Judson1360 I love #17 IF they're really thinking moving, I don't think Rivers even factors Chargers' decision. 
@Judson1360 Likewise, Bolts really think move LA best franchise, think Rivers, twilight career, sway them?

@AztecAllen @Jeremy_Nash Agree past I've felt there's legitimate opposition MW &amp; committee wasn't really exposed it.. 
@Jeremy_Nash @AztecAllen Coming season, WE W teams hoping get impress selection committee. Not more. 
@Jeremy_Nash @AztecAllen But who's big conference win that'd impress selection committee? Come Monday there'll ZERO ranked teams. 
@martinsohikish And P-Touch commercial? 👀 
@MatthiusBishop Thought wrong calling Aztecs "bubble team". Still think you're wrong. They're even good! *drinks* 
@sdutCanepa Your statement may correct mine. It's truth. 
@sdutCanepa You've always one problem, major one. Negativity.

@WeAreUNLV Hmm. I used Maybe team ranked 1 poll &amp; (Kinda like SDSU now)? I stand corrected. 
@NoID_Rich @WeAreUNLV @Justin_SDSJ Agreed. It's NCAA's. I'd compare tourney W's timeframe UNLV doesn't any. 
@WeAreUNLV @Justin_SDSJ UNLV vs. Top 25 (Regular season): '14-15 (1-1), '13-14 (0-4), '12-13 (3-2), '11-12 (3-2). Overall: 7-9. 
@WeAreUNLV @Justin_SDSJ What I get wrong? 
@Justin_SDSJ @WeAreUNLV Nothing right home either side. Vs. Top 25 teams last 4 years (Regular season): SDSU 9-10, UNLV 7-9

@AztecsTalk Yes program missed great opportunity win 10 games MW title. Coaching played big roll that. #AztecFB 
@619sports The Ruffin situation's disappointing. Misses final game Aztec. QK could've thrown instead refs &amp; security guards. 
@berniewilson This #TheWoirst game. 
@MatthewBain10 Very disappointing considering SDSU averaged 32,294 home season. #PoinsettiaBowl 
@Justin_SDSJ The Antelopes beat Lobos. #FuckYouFoodChain

@BParker17 SDSU ranked #13 3 short weeks ago rolled Seattle. Now UW #13 &amp; Aztecs AP Top 25. #Props 
#AztecMBB drop Top 25 (and deservedly so). Here's look voting via @colpolltracker 
@ArtJr619 @XTRA1360 The Chargers need Oliver hope continue win. We disagree roll. Agree disagree. Go Chargers! 
@ArtJr619 @XTRA1360 That change WILL happen season Mathews gives best opportunity postpone inevitable. 
@ArtJr619 @XTRA1360 The OL isn't healthy. That's point. I don't like Mathews he's versatile back. FWIW, 1 fumble 
@ArtJr619 @XTRA1360 Like not, #24 best RB. His days numbered (if healthy) gives Chargers best opportunity win now. 
@hacksaw1090 36K isn't bad? #AztecFB averaged 32K home year. 48K last time two met #PoinsettiaBowl. Deserves good turnout. 
@marcusSDTX @gaslampball You hit trifecta "AJ". Anthony, Jerry Rockstar GM. 
@octonion: AJ Preller trying baseball equivalent starting paperclip chain-trading house.

@GhostofRAK @ThisIsSan_Diego @kevintheoman @gaslampball Went follow Kevin &amp; found I'm blocked &amp; don't think we've ever interacted. Welp. 
Gwynn? “@andrewperloff: Overrated baseball players: Nolan Ryan, Derek Jeter, closer, Tony Gwynn.” 
@dennistlin Madison Bumgarner many HR's (4) Carlos Quentin done half many bats. 
@GhostofRAK Sound advice. 
@GhostofRAK I got sucked crossover couldn't turn away train wreck. Should've known better. 
@sdutPosner That sounds right. Thanks, couldn't find anywhere. Bottom line, NFL's blackout rule needs go. 
@sdutPosner When teams purchase tickets avoid blackout, don't cover small percentage actual ticket cost? 
@sdutPosner No chance. Between team sponsor(s), tickets purchased blackout lifted. #Chargers

@RJsFro @TheThinGwynn @gdarklighter @gaslampball @LeftCoastBias The relationship Padres &amp; LL continue. Stay tuned.. 
@RJsFro Not @Padres supporting local youth baseball, increases visibility brand &amp; helps recruit young fans. 
@RJsFro The LL uniform initiative one greatest marketing campaigns @Padres ever part of. I really hope continue 
@RJsFro Of course would. #perv 
@RJsFro If go w/ 1 retro brown uni's, sales wouldn't increase much new unique brown uni, sales would skyrocket 
@RJsFro No question revamped brown would come extensive costs wouldn't resulting merchandise sales help make that? 
@jesseagler Fri home games would've resulted 13 throwback dates. I like '15 fully expect sort permanent change '16 
@GhostofRAK Yeah, kinda like 77 wins would "progress". 
@GhostofRAK If Padres done TBT unis year, would've resulted 1 game throwbacks (5 vs 4). #PadresSH

@10NewsGriffith @BenHigginsSD I don't think taking honor away one deceased local icon giving another way go. 
@BenHigginsSD 2008 last time Padre got hit ASG. Adrian Gonzalez got single Joakim Soria 11th inning. 
@BenHigginsSD The fact FOX didn't even mention passing Gwynn Zimmer (almost 75 years MLB serve btwn them) inexcusable. 
@toasterposey: Also, MLB Fox aren't going honor Gwynn, ourselves. Here, I'll start. 
@THMead3 Also noticed I included one "r" overrate2. Jeter deserves better.

@Judson1360 @erniemartinezSD To ur point, current FO seems (confusing) plan core pieces. Maybe GM candidates confused too. 
@Judson1360 Don't think core shell Padres team would drastically effect attendance. Also don't think they're close contending.

@LeftCoastBias Do preference one (remaining) candidates?
