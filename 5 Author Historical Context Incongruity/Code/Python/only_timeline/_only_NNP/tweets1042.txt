In world football right now...very goalkeepers ball distribution skills Ithumeleng Khune has. Guy's sniper. 
Without touch hand Neymar's header going target. Good call 4th official. 
I've watched better halves. #UCLfinal. 
If Dutch going defend like this, Euro 2016 distant dream them. 
I would love watch Barcelona play Chelsea. Soon. These Spaniards wonderful watch it. 
Mesut Ozil. If there's one thing he's good at..it's seeing pass one else does. Great vision. 
I watched best game IPL. Virat Kholi wow. Now that's captain. 
Absolute carnage India. AB de Villiers naughty man. What player!!!! 
Andres Iniesta.....you naughty man!! Happy feet woooow. 
@mosdef3 Spot on. I wonder Jose playing though. Pushing Oscar work harder Saturday simply making space Cuadrado? 
In honesty one awarded Ballon d 'Or Messi retires. No one comes close guy. Happy feet. 
It time. Cmoooon United. 
I love watching IPL..and Henry Gayle mood...even better!! Go go RCB. 
A bit Masters action bed harmless I suppose. Good tv this. 
I scored 13/15 Mirror Squad numbers quiz @mirrorfootball. Too easy!! 
Damn...Brendon McCullum dangerous. Steyn won't forgetting mauling hurry! Good thing he's gone. #CWC15 
"@Psyfo_23: Had I car I'd needing service mileage accumulated today." Keep Walking Johnny. 
Well done Zimbabwe. Staying worth all....though I'm going suffer throughout day. #cwc15 
I used think Cristiano better Messi. He not... 
Terry cross.....Cahill flick...Ivanovic goal. Haha needs creative midfielders 3 opposition half. 
I'll give LVG one thing...his team difficult beat. No matter shit play, seem always find way out. And Falcao..oh dear! 
It tonight. Oddly delighted Mario. 
@mosdef3 I think too. Just needs decent run games now. 
These England strikers can't stop scoring. Ings money again. 
Dortmund massively booed fans Signal Iduna Park. Oh dear wheels come off. 
@Holik28 yeah city used bullying Arsenal toure's physicality definitely missed..but I think Wenger good plan today. 
The race position 3 4 BPL well truly now! Interesting month store. 
@mosdef3 Yep I liked display first 45. With Arteta Wilshere out, it's chance show he's got. 
I like Chamberlain scared trying difficult pass...that's attacking player do. 
Van Gaal won't last 3 years I think. He absolutely killed football DNA. Useless dominance possession. 
Hard classify United's recent perfomances football. I don't mind losing...but playing like this? We don't deserve top 4. 
@Niccklaus I'm sure everyone is. Every time scores feels like back real haha. 
We deserve lose one. Build play slowest I ever seen. Poor poor. It's frustrating watch fans this. 
@mosdef3 dare I forget "El Pistolero"...... 
Sad news footballer loses life...especially young age. RIP Junior Malanda. 
Wow wow wow. I never watched cricket match close. Hahaha unbelievable. #BBL04 
I love watching Big Bash League. Lovely t20 cricket display. 
@marsh2015 I never seen ordinary Barca display. Luis Enrique silly man. 
@Niccklaus whatever gets points. They earned points. INIGO MARTINEZ.. 
Watching Sociedad-Barca game. I discovered @ManUtd need. INIGO MARTINEZ. 
@BBCSporf: VIDEO: Superb behind-the-scenes footage Fernando Torres returning Atletico! Goosebumps!..http://t.co/00AEh2kcHr 
@Holik28 ah sha mafunnies. Good thing winning despite poor performances. 
Tryna figure 3rd league Yeovil rock bottom league. It's kinda performance United. 
The amount people awaiting Torres' unveiling Vicente Calderón crazy. Wish guy well. Good player him. 
I watch de Villiers bat five straight days still bored. Top top player. 
@Psyfo_23: It'd nice @premierleague 2014/15 title decided coin toss; fairytale stuff. 
I don't remember festive period quite wet. Rain rain everywhere. 
Player season far Belgian. Imperious. 
Watching this...may well take 89th minute goal break deadlock. Wasteful wasteful UNITED. Hope don't get punished. 
I scored 19/20 Mirror Liverpool quiz year quiz, beat me? @DailyMirror 
Hahaha hashtag killing me. #SomewhereInBulawayo 
@zbzoebrown I'm sure given chance would again. Haha 
It's easy say de Gea outright man match. Watch Michael Carrick again. Fellaini though wasteful possession...improved! 
Ander Herrera though..he must really poor training. Don't see LVG doesn't pick starting XI. 
@mosdef3 No No. I'm sorry homeboy. 
I also feel Sean Abbott....how coping fact bouncer took man's life. Very sad this. 
Everytime I watch Adam Lallana ball reminds Kaka AC Milan. Great talent England...!! 
Injured* 
I don't care injected isn't...these United players moment nothing. Arsenal want more. 
A message ICC @ABdeVilliers17. Hitting "cricketer year" parts field. Should award that. 
Don't think I'll ever watch anyone bat better @ABdeVilliers17. Effortlessly brilliant. 
This makings great ODI. Aussies feel defend low total. South Africa place right now. 
@Holik28 I'd rather beat everyone win league. Gives us didn't lose chance UCL next season 
I proud @ManUtd fan right now. So much fight squad. All one ask really. The DERBY walkover lately. 
Haven't enjoyed DERBY bit.I'm certainly loving one. We may lose eventually...but fight certainly good one watch. 
After today I confidence @ManUtd team. Great fight. Chances created. Most expected us blown away. 
I don't care Chelsea high flying. We United. We Theatre Dreams. We defend colours. Cmon United United. 
Everytime I see Lallana playing I think Kaka AC Milan vs Man Utd. Brilliant player good future. 
@mosdef3 yeah smooth operator night. Lots hard work well. It's pity won't get nod ahead fit Bale. 
One day I'd love Anfield join "You never walk alone" anthem...Goosebump stuff. Big European night. 
I don't like Monday Night Football team playing. West Brom tricky affair. Berahino main threat. Gotta grind win. 
Greenpoint Stadium I come. Ajax Cape Town vs Kaizer Chiefs. 8 wins 8 Amakhosi? Certainly hope so. Ikhosi alipheli umoya. 
@zsiebusiso I'm Cape Town Ajax Chiefs game. Sorry mate. 
@zsiebusiso Good work friend. 
"Its 35 yards more...too far Ronaldo think it...Oooooh..Absolutely sensational." @zsiebusiso 
Haha poor Pakistan. The choke chokes. What brilliant end ODI. Credit Glenn Maxwell. What's love sport? 
Good hear Jules breathing now. Wish lad speedier recovery full fitness. 
What I'd give Ellis Park right now. Carnival atmosphere. 
@marsh2015 I hear wanted quit football thought wasn't good enough. He right. He good enough. Trolled!! 
It's like United shortage firepower. Welbeck 4th choice striker. His hat trick compliment us. End of. 
I love way United look going forward. I don't love way defend. I didn't like way Clatternburg ref'd game. Spoiled it. 
@thydopeness When When When....coz I'm ready. 
Scintillating football Goodison Park. Yes I might addicted football. 
@Psyfo_23 @zsiebusiso NO WE DIDN'T. WE WERE WAITING FOR VALENCIA AND ABEL HERNANDEZ. 
@mosdef3: Di Maria class... takes defenders willingly, beats them! In grand scheme things, Madrid bigg… 
Just good beating QPR 3-0 half time feels shows far fallen. Good team performance. Today winning. More plz. 
With way games went Saturday, win today ideal result us. Good chance kick start season. Cmon @ManUtd. 
Is powerful left foot Kolarov's EPL? What hit. 
Football game Arsenal play well Man City score goal. I love game. 
I genuinely hope Welbeck scores today. 
So Arsenal City midweek games Dortmund Bayern. Interesting see team selections today's game. 
I scored 6/10 Mirror Pro Evo/FIFA likenesses quiz quiz, beat me? via @mirrorfootball 
@zbzoebrown I couldn't agree more. 
Nishikori. Stop it. It's Djokovic. 
I scored 0/10 Mirror The non-football quiz quiz, beat me? via @mirrorfootball 
@KICKTV: #Argentina leading #Germany 4:2 aggregate look set new world champions! 
@zsiebusiso @marsh2015 The skipper..coz I can't really say hole. If is...then fell deep hole. 
@marsh2015 came shock Chicharito move. Good player though. Better watch champions league bench tv. 
The I watch Sturridge Sterling impress me. Could go become really world class players. Possible Galacticos. 
Don't know I don't like sound Falcao United. Maybe it's figures United paying. 
@zsiebusiso @marsh2015 @Psyfo_23 Madrid managed sign Chicharito superstar quietly. They keep I care. 
I like selfish striker. I like Sturridge. You won't score unless shoot. Simple that. 
Interesting match Lane today. Hopefully Balotelli starts though unlikely. Loved watching EPL. Not much Serie A. 
If anyone gets @Superbru Margin Point Everton - Chelsea game, deserve yellow cap that. 
If going base play wings best crossers ball wing. If Young Valencia are....then... 
I feel Man Utd English national team's futures. Rooney can't even control ball. That nothing new system. 
Poor 1st half performance. Looks promising International break real midfielders join squad likes Young go. 
From experience research laboratory, one life lesson I picked things don't go smoothly often not. 
Hahaha. A lot people talking COSMIN MOTI next days. What legend. 
I don't undstnd people taking swipe LVG signing autographs kids losing four nil. Should ignore kids instead? 
I'd love see James Wilson Andreas Perrera though. The rest stay MK Dons. Or whatever town club resides. 
I walk straight @ManUtd team command first team spot week week out. In position. 
I feel sorry people Man Utd heart. The future looks bleak. MK Dons dominating us. Wow. 
@Psyfo_23 Put proper 2 month diet I run United midfield. They can't make tricky pass makes Iniesta great. Poor 
What see Cleverly managers. In Young. In Smalling. In Fletcher. Mid table finish achievement lot. 
@zsiebusiso @Psyfo_23 NO. It 352 formation. 
Jack Wilshere like Englishman overrated. I mean nicest possible way. Ozil Arsenal....the less said better. 
I like United done Rojo. Go cheap, available player potential see happens. 
I love player hands transfer request secure move elsewhere. Shows player really wants matter what. 
From I've seen...the Proteas easily get 350 runs loss maximum 3 wickets. Zim bowlers captain clueless. 
@zsiebusiso can't blame him. Young shoulder blame. It's like Bony scored str8 Blackett's pass. 
@zsiebusiso yeah. But immediate danger then. I say it's Young. He headed ball away. 
I like Blackett. Looks part. 
Today 3 points. Good football follow next week. Win pretty win ugly. It doesn't matter. Just WIN. Cmoooon @ManUtd. 
@marsh2015 I don't see fits this. He another Isco. 
@marsh2015 someone quiet game. And it's Benzema. I wonder who..uhmmm! 
@marsh2015 gotta say Dortmund poor too. But I agree...they look compact team. Will interesting finishes top 3. 
@BoringMilner: I said Frank Lampard we're normally team England Man City. He said I know, Jam… 
Coutinho top player. Sterling go world beater. It's one creating path other. @mosdef3 
Raheem Sterling handful season. Hopefully won't get injured. The one Liverpool player I enjoy watching. 
That's four dubious wickets now!! FOUR!! It's shame No. 1 test team get one...not 2..not 3..but 4 gifts Zim. Poor. 
@zsiebusiso coz Ndebele I'm Ndebele? Tribalism. Stop it. 
Really wish I Harare next 5 days. Always makes good atmosphere cricket Harare Sports Club. 
12 Wilson tennis balls R150? No way I'm buying that. Cheap stuff expensive. 
Good end productive week. Home bound. 
Di Maria Vermaelen don't need. De Jong Vidal good one too. I don't like buying big name sake it. 
@zbzoebrown @WOOLWORTHS_SA I approve message. Can't get enough those. 
@marsh2015 @zsiebusiso @Psyfo_23 definite Solksjaer. Impact player. Always bench win games. He good enough that. 
@zsiebusiso @Psyfo_23 LVG. In Cup Final. Against Scousers. There way I missing that. 
@Psyfo_23 2 CBs. One ball playing like Rio. One no-nonsense like Vidda. And warrior CM. Arturo...though I'd prefer Turan. 
@Psyfo_23 pre-season comes Liverpool. If could beat us 8-0 would have. Brilliant United. 
These US kick times aren't Southern Africa friendly. 2am football match really. I pass. 
@_iamGerald I admire intentions. However, bit mis-informed virus it's transmissibility. Go read again. 
@mosdef3 Indeed. If didn't score (which often), he'd notch assist two. Just brilliant. 
Will definitely miss days I didn't worry pick Fantasy Team captain. #ElPistolero 
If Moyes managed tough time Kitchee FC Singha XI, one wonders could happened ICC tourney. 
I know pre-season friendlies. But I would rather win lose. A positive mindset new season essential. 
Meanwhile Proteas ripping Sri Lankans. The Steyn Remover fire. I love sport. Should take day off. 
@zsiebusiso I don't understand it. It's LVG special. 
@zsiebusiso I'd rather perfect it. Gives us massive hold many team..though need alternative big teams. 
Besides flattering scoreline, United pretty impressive. Good movement. Bold passes. Positive energy. The United way. 
American commentators use words I've never heard used football match before. 
Hope I don't regret waking early watch @ManUtd play first game tour. Long day awaits. 
Jah Cure - Before I Leave. Good music. 
@zsiebusiso never thought I'd live long enough see say that. 
@ICC: 141 Sikandar Raza saw Zimbabwe beat @ACBofficials comfortably 8 wickets Second ODI. #ZimvAfg 
Hahaha SA Idols. Some comedy gold right there. 
Lovely see likes Florian Mayer well. Great 1st serve. Lovely backhand. Good final. Ferrer didn't favours. 
@zsiebusiso @Psyfo_23 @marsh2015 kuda mahachi. Easy!!! I'm tournament co-ordinator. 
@DStvCare I'm getting E19-4 error code Wifi drifta. CA4145761511. Help fix please. 
In entire footballing history, one opposition team put hands winners' trophy? Doubt it. Come Demichelis. 
@zsiebusiso @Psyfo_23 @marsh2015 CR7 happy bunny. Imagine Messi won trophy. The debate would settled. 
I fear Higuain Palacios' houses back home Argentina. Culprits tonight. 
@mosdef3: Its one games feel one goal it... time typa game go dreaded penal… 
@DStvCare I'm getting E19-4 error code Wifi drifta. CA4145761511. Help fix please.

"@_iamGerald: As I Always Say: If You Take My Tweets Personal NDEZVAKO." newewo NDEZVAKO. 
If Arsenal imanage secure services one Alexis Sanchez...then I consider serious title contenders. Top player that. 
If name starts "K" likely score game. #Kroos #Klose #Khedhira. Bring back #Kaka fight. 
CLASSIC: Tennis players responses question "How Do You Eat Your Strawberries?". @zsiebusiso @Psyfo_23 
@Psyfo_23 I don't understand last statement. You may wanna take another look it. Son. 
That's one thing I hate de Villiers' game. Throwing wicket away well set set ton. 
Owwwww I see now. What makes Neuer better keeper long remains upright. So many quick go ground. 
@DStvCare I'm getting E19-4 error code Wifi drifta. CA4145761511. Help fix please. 
Colombia seem lot people's favourite Brazil. I believe see opposite. The crowd drive Samba boys home 
@Psyfo_23 @zsiebusiso @ManUtd going tournament. That exactly I think Hummels too. 
I'm definitely getting 2014-15 @ManUtd home shirt. Love it. The shirt champions. 
@rmuguwu I always pay price morning watching game went extra time. Zzzzz 
To think I almost retired bed 2-0. Would missed best part game 
Argh fock man. I miss days "Golden Goal". Coulda bed now. 
With misses like this, I want game go penalties already. 0-0 10 penalties. 
@GeniusFootball: If USA win World Cup.. 
@FootballFunnys: I tried follow Tim Howard twitter. Got blocked. 
It wouldn't cup without pitch invasion. Fair play lad. 
Thanks coming Africa. Good night. Love, Ze Engineers. 
I love Germans pass tight spots. Exquisite 
Neuer playing right left back today. I love keeper like that. Amazing starting position. 
Somebody tell Algerians can't defend 90 minutes. They eventually concede. In 90th minute. 
@mosdef3 gutted I saw piece news. It's like mission destroy empire. 
I honestly think Robben didn't dive there. It penalty day. An earlier, well deserved one wasn't given. It evens out. 
When I said Chile cup, yall laughed like far fetched dream. Anyone? Chile anyone? Going now. Not going twice. Gone. 
Black Label + Sapathi Mutton Gravy..just perfect way kick weekend. Hanging Indians. 
@BBCSporf: BREAKING: Liverpool receive £80 million offer Luis Suarez German side Borussia Munchonacentreback. 
Goalkeepers protected. I can't say enough. 
USA impressive every time I watch play. Growing leaps bounds game call "soccer". 
Impatient. Naive. Disrespectful. Sir Alex dealt youthful tendencies kept young Pogba. He is/was worth it. 
The Enforcer. Good night. Thank coming. 
It may silly view Fernandinho appears better midfield option comparison Little Paul. Defensive yet attacking. 
No way I'm watching Mexico-Croatia second half. The Neymar show appealing point time. Samba samba. 
@zsiebusiso I never said anything minutes goals ratio. You did. 
@Psyfo_23 it's actual goal per say. It occasion. The significance. The timing. All packed single shot. Greal goal 
It's fair team parks bus 90 minutes beaten manner. Haha.. 
La Puluuuuuuuuuuuuga. Messssssssssssssssssssssiiiiiiiii. Even I loved that. The best deliver biggest occasions. Over CR7. 
The #Haka never gets old. Love every time I watch it. I bet opposition love too...if doesn't scare them. 
@Psyfo_23 I also heard Benz took shot...but hurry ref....added time elapsed. 
@Psyfo_23 yes. You wanted say "small" mistakenly went "tall". It happens know. 
I would much love know one individual said "Benzema going France's next Zidane." 
Poor Insigne poor. Why ever come on? Prandelli lost plot "impact" subs. They impact alright. 
I know Prandelli wanted achieve sent Cassano onto pitch. Knock England maybe? 
In many ways @BoringMilner reminds good friend @Psyfo_23 . Striking similarity personality through. 
Hodgson staff also let English down. At 1-1, attacked caution. Instead hands pump. Poor! 
"@theliks69: I strongly feel England turn things around here" really? 
"Albaaaa. In dreams. Perhaps case nightmares." Gotta love Peter Drury commentaries. 
A lot people laughed I told I backing Chile World Cup. Who laughing now...hahahaha! 
Haiwa Casillas dribbled fun forwards..haha Saint Iker kudii ibvai apo. 
@Psyfo_23 It's game. 
Time watch team I backed tournament started. C'mon Chile. A win today world champions out. Tasty that. 
The I watch Brazil defend less convinced I get chances lifting World Cup trophy. Poor poor. 
Secretly hoping 92nd minute Iran goal. 
African Champions giving Iran Asia. Something wrong statement. 
If African teams going play like Nigeria are, i'd rather see non last 16. Poor silly long balls. Pass it.. 
@Psyfo_23 every time Mikel gets ball plays long ball forward appaling accuracy. Iran passing better moment. 
Stop long balls outpass Iranians. Simple. Oh wait..they can't pass either. Too much pace wee bit brain. 
@Mathuthu: Nigeria vs Iran. May best terrorist win! *Stolen* 
They qualified via playoffs relatively easy group Cristiano's individual brilliance. If doesn't deliver...well.... 
@FootballFunnys: Only World Cup make stay watch Ivory Coast v Japan 
Baines' wing. I said it. Poor poor. 
Rooney enough assist Baines defending wing. Might channel Italians exploit second half. 
Sterling tooooo young pass like that. Xavi-espue. Iniesta-esque. Quality. Rooney Sturridge. Lethal attack that. 
Straight training ground. Pure quality. Italians set piece. Masters. 
This game open. Makes tired second half display this. # England # Italy 
It take lot top perfomance Dutch masters. Best world cup game I watched bit. 
Football porn abundance match...should saved Peter Drury I said.. 
Iniestaaaaa...stop it. naughty ball that...Silva though.. 
Xaxi Xavi...Iniesta Iniesta. Double double magic. A wonder watch. 
Oscaaaaaaaaaaaaaar. Man Match. Thank coming. Good night. 
If Brazil expect win world cup defending like fooling themselves. Shambolic really. 
"@NtombsDee: Brazilian women beautiful" And you. 
It's morning Brazil World Cup...4 years waiting finally over. C'mon Chile. Should least get last 8.

@mosdef3 I'd agree w u there. Would interesting know u feel "qualifying winning it" 
I'd rather #BPL trophy stay city Manchester. 
@Psyfo_23 @zsiebusiso lose 6-1 aggregate I'll happy man. That scoreline mean you!! 
I hope @lfc beef squad next season juggling #UCL #BPL hectic. Their attack impressive though.

Woooooow! Just WOOOW. Look eyes @DaleSteyn62. Menacing!!! The guy simply INCREDIBLE. What winner! #wt20

@mosdef3 When I said I wanted @lfc #UCL I didn't mean expense. 
@Psyfo_23 sure mean I don't know respond that. 
"@YungAmbition: I predict #MUFC get Atletico Madrid CL draw #MUFCdraw" We getting Real Madrid again. 
@mosdef3 Indeed. Today result. Engineering comeback important. Doesn't change season though. #poor 
Good managers preserve one goal lead. Great managers go jugular. Up Mr Moyes. #UCL 
My post #MUNLIV timeline hilarious. Clearly @lfc hurt lot people. Can't help laugh stuff I'm seeing 
I stomach loss 90 teams across four divisions England Wales. Just @lfc. 
I judge Moyes December summer transfer window. Fergie left near-impossible task kinda squad.
