@GordyClement @fd_VillaNews Just think Benteke Bony similar sort players think £28/£30m I'd get rid 
@GordyClement @fd_VillaNews To honest I don't think he's going anytime soon seems invincible

Would love Phillipe Senderos prove us Villa fans wrong prove top notch centre half #avfc #utv 
Senderos Villa?? Would rather Grant Holt back play centre back Villa Park next season #avfc 
Although sounds like aload old cobblers, I would Roy Keane Villa heartbeat, kick squad shape #avfc 
Roy Keane turning Celtic job become Lambert's assistant Villa, hardly blame Villa fans little bit apprehensive 
Man City looking offload Richards, Barry, Lescott Rodwell, players would perfect Villa #avfc #utv 
@HolteEnders1874 Dwight Yorke best player ive seen Villa, worst got either Habib Beye Bosko Balaban 
Personally cant see Lambert Villa beyond next week along Paul Faulkner #avfc #utv 
Shame Villa's name hasnt linked Joleon Lescott, Man City wanting get rid plus would perfect partner Vlaar #avfc 
@thegoalzone I think Villa fans glad get club sold move summer bring quality management players 
Fan takeovers/buyout good lower league clubs club Villa's statue need huge investment compete Prem League #avfc 
I still think David Moyes Michael Laudrup would two top names Villa go summer #avfc

Bring summer, potential new owners new manager, going huge summer Villa Park #avfc #utv

@t_fresh101: Team I got: Aston Villa Do I hate them? No Best player : Weimann Worse player : Delphi My team : Chelsea team 
Wholesale changes needed Villa top bottom, Lerner, Faulkner Lambert need go #avfc #LernerOut #LambertOut 
Fantastic game Bernabeu end-to-end action, definitely makes garbage Villa earlier #ElClasico 
@JamesNursey Jelle Vossen Genk rumoured twitter maybe heading Villa? Any truth that? 
@JamesNursey Have heard truth rumours Villa interested Bradford forward Nahki Wells? 
Come Villa!!! Fantastic result today lads #avfc 
Come Villa boys, beauty #avfc 
If Villa get £20m/£30m Benteke I'd happy that, Lambert invest another gem fight shirt #avfc 
If Villa get rid Benteke would look bring Romelu Lukaku, ready made replacement fits criteria #avfc 
Stiliyan Petrov true legend Aston Villa Football Club, inspired leader great role model #avfc 
A truly magnificent performance Villa boys last night thoroughly deserved, gives us huge confidence last 3 games #avfc #utv 
Di Canio would brilliant Villa, wouldnt stand rubbish would definately kick squad shape 
@talkSPORTDrive Weimann process signing new contract Villa 
Yet Villa ruin another weekend us fans, least arent breaking tradition season consistant 
What player manager half brain cell would join sinking ship Aston Villa Football Club, relegation inevitable 
Bennett, Bannan, Clark, 3 worse players ever put Villa shirt #avfc 
Are people seriously suprised Villa's performance?? 
@SkyFootball: Aston Villa made enquiry Inter Milan winger Philippe Coutinho, according player's agent. ... 
Huddlestone, Palacios, Dawson, Heitinga, Lescott, none players would look twice joining Villa moment #avfc 
Bradford deserve credit tonight, Villa players took even 1% heart showed tonight would unbeatable 
Although completely embaressing night us still think thrash Bradford Villa Park theyve 15 minutes fame 
Whats happened team, ive never seen garbage produced Villa team life, gotten bad 
@tancredipalmeri: Aston Villa contacted Inter ask Coutinho. No bid made, mentioned possible 10m € offer 
@avstu After depressing xmas us Villa fans football-wise good watch quality sport take mind 
Arsenal linked Arda Turan, David Villa Yann M'Villa today, 3 quality players would definately improve 
KEA's performance today showed shouldnt million miles Villa team, reckless, poor ball...#avfc 
@Der_Wanderfalke: I'd rather Villa fan, watching team get thumped jumped-up glory hunter barely knows ups & ... 
@davidmcgreevy Im still proud Villa feel hard work past couple weeks gone waste

@OfficialLFC: RODGERS: "This season everyone seen quality Villa - losing home disgrace." 
@avstu: Charlie Nicholas, "Villa's second goal Barcelona like" #avfc 
@FootballAgenda: That second Villa goal reminiscent United Rooney/Tevez/Ronaldo. Classy. 
Come Villa boys, bring home #avfc 
@Nufcniallers I didnt say would come Villa said sort player need 
@TJVillan Hes type defender need, like Lowton played League One last season looks complete ease Prem 
@TJVillan Id put Weimann left seems cut inside alot would benefit stronger foot, id definatley play Ireland 
@TJVillan I think Weimann sometimes lacks composure ball struggles first touch, Gabby struggled lately 
@TJVillan Hes aloud one bad game, id love us bag another win QPR, need experience defenders 
According Ian Danter, Bent Villa Park tonight stormed ground left #avfc 
@talkdants: Darren Bent Villa Park tonight. Not more. I'm told he's stormed stadium driven away fro ... 
Id love see young back four get clean sheet tonight, come Villa #avfc 
@RonVlaar4: On way Villa Park. Unfortunately can't play tonight, hope back saturday. Let's support lads!! Come on! ... 
@TJVillan Jean Makoun got sent last week Paris St Germain 
@neo_Villan @dannycass99 How Scott Parker? 
@neo_Villan @dannycass99 I like luck Wanyama Celtic, solid player middle park chips odd goal 
@dannycass99 @neo_Villan To honest id Westwood Bannan centre Holman playing advanced role 
@neo_Villan @dannycass99 Get bung Delph KEA 
@neo_Villan I think moment could him, Vlaar would need figure head back 
@neo_Villan Isnt Dunne meant back soon? Herd, Dunne, Bennett Vlaar looking good 
Didnt agree KEA starting performance justified Villa fans concern, Holman made difference came #avfc 
Dennis Mortimer holding aloft European Cup head would perfect motivator players enter Villa Park #avfc 
@jonnygould Who would like see Villa January, Jonny? 
@TJVillan I cant see young manager would go there, ruined AVBs reputation country 
Villa really seemed missed trick Michael Bradley, looks blossoming quality player Roma season #avfc 
@Greg9wGreg: Aston Villa European cup winners midlands side won ever belt sandwell 
@mattletiss7 Do think Villa stay season Tiss? 
@VillaDude I hear Neil Lennon rates £25m, looked good Barcelona night 
@VillaDude I agree, think someone like Mulumbu WBA Wanyama Celtic would perfect us, vital experience 
@VillaDude Westwood looked top quality, think would improve alot experienced partner next 
@TJVillan Stevens looked natural back, comfortable never looked intimidated sight Valencia 
Victor Wanyama looks like ideal player Villa looking for, strong, huge engine would great job front back 4 #avfc 
@Paulmcgrath5 Do see Villa turning corner win Sunderland, Paul? 
Fantastic result Villa yesterday, Benteke justifying faith Lamberts put him, Vlaar also looked solid ever #avfc 
@FifaChat I would Valencia, always breeding ground quality players Mata, Villa, Alba, Joaquin, etc 
@MatKendrick Villa struggled show consistancy composure throughout game, passing keeping ball seemed far comfortable 
@VillaDude I agree, mean suprised beating Man City league cup 
@VillaDude One team think come good QPR, many quality players go 
@VillaDude @dave1avfc @AVFCBlog We seemed completely oblivious corner taken, lack concerntration cost us 
@dave1avfc @AVFCBlog @VillaDude For Lambert taken Bennett half time, looked reckless walking tight rope 
@AVFCBlog @VillaDude @dave1avfc For Gabby played Albrightons position switched Holman,then Bent Benteke 
@VillaDude For Adam Johnson Pienaar would perfect us, Gabby hes v poor long time 
@VillaDude One player think could got Pienaar, way Spurs cost Everton 2m, hard working pacey 
@VillaDude @dave1avfc @AVFCBlog I like Weimann shame hes got Gabby Benteke Bent compete 
@YhQ92 @VillaDude @dave1avfc @AVFCBlog Delph simillar Albrighton, alot potential hasnt lived 
@VillaDude Would try Holman CM, work rate round play could work perfectly alongside someone like Herd 
@VillaDude @dave1avfc @AVFCBlog Benteke played well too, shame didnt give service else could pushed 
@VillaDude I think lack depth meant Lambert choice, shame couldnt got Adam Johnson would perfect 
@dave1avfc @VillaDude I hope Lerner give Lambert cash Jan, 2 decent wingers must too, CZ MA havent good enough 
@VillaDude @dave1avfc @AVFCBlog I agree, missing Petrov effect had, KEA Delph looking really poor 
@dave1avfc @VillaDude I think Herd played well make-shift centre half Vlaar immense end 
@VillaDude Albrighton awful today, ran around like headless chicken times end product 
@Phil_Thompson4 What think Villa's performance today Phil? Im worried us staying up, lack quality composure 
@Paulmcgrath5 Is anyway us Villa fans tempt back retirement? We desperatley need 
Probably worse football ive ever seen Villa side, Guzan Benteke hold heads high, could rout #avfc 
Can Villa really stay poor performance? I doubts #avfc 
Villa havent got luxury rest best players, Bent Ireland playing #avfc 
I see Thomas Hitzlsperger bench Everton today, top player whenever put Villa jersey 
@VillaDude Id like see Dunne Vlaar partnered together, look solid pairing seems better option Clark 
@VillaDude I really hope Benteke improves, 7m alot money us days 
@VillaDude We havent got luxury like teams rest best players, matches like need 
@VillaDude The likes Bent first name teamsheet, hes best player starting games 
@VillaDude I cant see going improve, many poor performances results becoming predictable game game... 
Proud Villa fan morning last nights performance, particular Gabby looked fantastic top form #avfc 
2-0 Villa today Benteke Ireland goals #avfc 
@ClaridgeSteve How reckon Villa season? Can see Paul Lambert pushing top half finish? #askSteve 
@VillaDude I agree, think Ben Afra looks quality player final pass lacking

@cdlpavfc @villabone Hopefully hes going focus Villa actually attract names club 
Would Villa fan Luke Young back? #avfc 
@VillaDude Moyes done fantastic job Everton Fellani Jagielka Baines Jelavic Gibson brilliant signings 
@VillaDude Lowton Ahmadi Holman Bannan Delfoneso N'Zogbia...these players wouldnt get Wigans first team 
@VillaDude Evertons team paper far better ours, Villa players Bent make difference 
Everton far better team bought shoe string budget, Villas team sheet grim reading Ahmadi, Lowton, Holman comparison #avfc

If Villa fans could 3 players end transfer window would be? #avfc

@VillaFansUnited @astonvilla05 Another player like Jack Butland, reminds lot Joe Hart 
@astonvilla05 @VillaFansUnited I hope sign rather loan him, wouldnt want repeat Kyle Walker 
@VillaDude I think Steven Caulker loan Spurs would good 
@VillaFansUnited My starting XI - Given - Lowton Vlaar Dunne Bertrand - El Ahmadi Makoun - Sinclair Ireland Gabby - Bent 
@VillaFansUnited I think Adam Johnson would great signing exactly need 
@VillaFansUnited For left back id Ryan Bertrand, winger Scott Sinclair striker Daniel Sturridge, maybe Steven Caulker centre back

Can see Martinez going Villa Liverpool turning Brendan Rodgers, personally id happy him, young hungry #avfc 
Cant see happening would love see Di Matteo Villa Poyet assistant Eddie Newton coaching staff #avfc 
@General_Krulak Any thoughts rebranding franchise? Maybe Aston Allstars? Villa Vipers? 
Heard Glenn Hoddles name mentioned briefly Villa job? Any Villa fan that? Seems like last ditch option #avfc 
@VillaDude Who would 3? Personally id Lambert doesnt seem keen idea lately 
If Benitez become next Villa manager Lerner back think would perfect, big name big club #avfc 
There chance Rafa Benitez joining Villa, Lerner couldnt afford neither could back funds, absolutely chance #avfc 
Can see next Villa manager either Paul Lambert, Roberto Martinez Roberto Di Matteo, hope appoint someone soon #avfc 
@Football_Mole Has Lee Clark ever mentioned candidate Villa job?? 
@VillaDude Cant see anyone past him, see Martinez going Liverpool, maybe Di Matteo clutching straws 
@TheLadyVilla I suppose arent many football teams Canada follow there? 
@TheLadyVilla Do go Villa much? 
@VillaDude I mean MK Dons Karl Robinson John Gorman hos number 2, experienced head beside him, Kevin McDonald would ideal 
Lets get 'Baby Faced Assassin' Villa Park, Villa fans get behind get club rocking #avfc #upthevilla 
@VillaDude Maybe experienced number 2 could give experience, maybe Steve Clarke someone statue 
@VillaDude Just hope doesnt turn like AvB Chelsea, big reputation abroad didnt hack Prem 
@VillaDude Well managed United reserves Norway good idea managing youngsters, huge potential #avfc 
@StanCollymore Would Michael Owen Villa Stan? 
Anyone think temptation Villa job Dalglish's mind walked away? He seems like challenge #avfc #lfc 
@VillaDude If go guarentee relegation, surely Lerner couldnt 
@VillaDude Could Mick McCarthy Steve Bruce suprise? 
@VillaDude Nothing suprises Lerner anymore, hasnt got clue 
@VillaDude Paul Lambert got next manager, huge potential, sooner rather later hope 
@raceyemu I think McLeish Villa fans welcome anyone, cant get worse 
@Roberto_1875 @VillaFansUnited I think likes Harveys looking sponsoring club rate bed sheets 
@robertwildey @VillaFansUnited After damage McLeish done dont think Villa fans take next appointment granted 
@VillaFansUnited Our season long protest McLeish finally over, Villa fans unite back new gaffer ever 
If true Claudio Ranieri wants Villa id put top list, high profile manager, bags European experience #avfc 
Potential £3.5m Piennar, thats snap good player would love see Villa #avfc 
@VillaDude You never no, im abit cautious Curbishleys name touted around though AvB #avfc certain ring 
@VillaDude Yea think either Martinez Lambert, hopefully latter, cant really see candidates moment 
@VillaDude Do think theres chance Villa looking Ranieri??

@VillaDude I think season shown little Lerner Faulkner football 
@VillaDude In place Faulkner maybe? To honest think would good move 
@VillaDude Do think likely Lerner hire Comolli? 
@HowardHodgson Me too, seems fit Villa perfectly would hugd hit supporters 
If Villa hadnt awful season, Andy Carroll Jermain Defoe potentially available, great partnership...if

@McLeish_Out Real fans McLeish worse thing ever happen Aston Villa Football Club, im doubt go 
@VillaDude Well appointed Houllier, missed Martinez hired McLeish, doesnt boad well future appointments 
@VillaDude Id like either Lambert Lee Clark, knowing Lerner probably go Mick McCarthy 
@VillaDude I hear Louis Van Gaal's name mentioned, experience bringing youngsters European pedigree 
@VillaDude Maybe Pep Guadiola would like challenge Villa 
@VillaDude I dont think Guzan stay, Carruthers looks great little player Gardner captain making 
@VillaDude Weimann Delfoneso could deadly partnership, Baker Clark Lichaj back, looks promising 
@VillaDude To fair weve got great youngsters could take Championship storm 
@VillaDude He suitable League 1 League 2 football, disgrace called Premier League manager 
@VillaDude I think McLeish walk, would someone want go this?

Stiliyan Petrov true professional fantastic servant Villa, hope makes full recovery, top guy #avfc 
@tSTransfer: Transfer rumours: Aston Villa eyeing summer swoop Spartak Moscow striker @talkSPORT 
If Villa wasnt strict budget would love see go Berbatov hes available, would ideal us #avfc #mufc 
I think Victor Moses would another good option Villa summer Wigan go down, although Junior Hoilett better option #avfc 
Its criminal guys like Lee Clark Terry McDermot work, id Villa heartbeat #avfc #nufc 
@StanCollymore Fantastic see Herd Gardner Weimann representing Villas youth set proving heart Villa 
@McLeish_Out Im happy either considering past weeks weve had, beats normal saturday feeling Villa fan

@TEAMtalk So much press conference Villa, credability whatsoever... 
John Carew Villa legend #avfc 
Instead Roy Hodgson England Roy Hodgson Villa??? #avfc #wba 
@VillaDude I like look Weimann shouldnt rushed, Fonz real disapointment Premier League quality 
@VillaDude I plays Championship really like look Southamptons Richie Lambert, looks carbon copy Grant Holt 
@VillaDude McLeish looked like world beater 2 team league, comes English game doesnt clue 
@SashaStevens84 At moment id take Birmingham fan...although im desperate yet 
@VillaDude I heard Villa could signed Cabaye opted join Newcastle us 
@VillaDude I think looked abroad find gems like Newcastle Tiote Cabaye 
@VillaDude Who think realistically would good signings, Rodallega wants leave Wigan like Junior Hoillett #mcleishout 
@VillaDude Me either, see Dunne Collins Warnock Ireland going summer 
@VillaDude Well Guthrie Davis Naismith name few, average players would suit Championship 
@TFS_AstonVilla: I'm starting tonight enough enough #MCLEISHOUT #AVFC 
@VillaDude Bosmans loans players touted around, current team could look like Wigan second string side hes still 
@VillaDude I agree dont go season, players hes looking at, go next season #mcleishout 
@SashaStevens84 Ive never felt dejected Villa fan, future charge doesnt bare thinking #mcleishout 
Come Villa boys!!! #avfc 
Cant complain Villas starting XI strongest team could picked, good see Herd back #avfc 
Would like see Hoillett Villa next season, pacey winger think hes contract summer #avfc 
I hear Romelu Lukaku wants go loan, would ideal Villa problems front #avfc 
@TFS_AstonVilla: McLeishs PL record played 127 games, won 32, drawn 46 lost 49. 5th worst PL history. #avfc #awful ... 
@MatKendrick With loses cause concern future Villa? I mean involving increased debt spending beyond means 
We need huge overhaul Villa starting Randy Lerner, Paul Faulkner Alex McLeish, drastic changes needed #avfc 
Andy Weimann natural finisher would welcome addition starting XI Keane goes back, future Villa star #avfc 
Great see crop Villas youth shown throughout todays team, Albrighton Gardner Bannan Weimann Baker Herd bright future #avfc 
@NotPcAtAll_01: Had accident? Hurt @ home work? Tripped over? Then careful clumsy BASTARD!! #soundadvice 
@MatKendrick Id consider playing Heskey centre back, Dion Dublin played towards end Villa career 
@MatKendrick Villa need change tactics, 4-4-2 would show attacking intent rather negative defensive minded 4-2-3-1 
I predict next manager get sack is...Andre Villas Boas 
I think order McLeish make Villa needs ship old guards MON era like Dunne Collins #avfc.... 
@VillaDude At moment seem Villa turn 45 minutes game, maybe McLeish plan whole game one half 
Robbie Keane excellent, best player pitch Villa country mile #avfc 
Im glad Villa turned Roberto Martinez, deluded manager thinks Wigan improving, rooted bottom 
Villa played really nice stuff last night wish could whole match last hour #avfc 
So another transfer window passes Villa buying nobody, almost becoming tradition every year #avfc 
@AaronGrey90 I dont think ever good Villa, hes average best 
Again Blues WBA fight amoungst another Villa reject #avfc #bcfc #wba 
"@TransferTalk_: Villa boss McLeish: I tried sign Barcelona star Messi Rangers"...is taking mick??? 
Did Villa fans really expect anything different, going club moment, mid table best #avfc 
What hell Villa playing at??? 
Really think get result Emirates today, Ireland Gabby back give us huge boost, 2-1 Villa #avfc 
@astonvillatoday Villa wont sign anyone else, policy sell buying proved that, like every transfer window 
Always Clint Dempsey fan, underrated player would slot perfectly Villa #avfc 
Villa pull stops get Robbie Keane signed permanently, hes cutting edge weve missing #avfc 
@AVFCOfficial: Villa's U18s beat Blues 4-0 today. Jordan Graham, Bradley Lewis, Malcolm Melvin Darious Darkin goals. #avfc 
@VillaDude I really cant see anything changing, deep deep trouble 
@VillaDude Thats positive cant Lerner taking notice, seems feel McLeish man job 
We seem picking points away home season hope continues, Come Villa boys #avfc 
Hatem Ben Afra looks quality winger something lacking, dont much hes would good Villa #avfc #nufc 
Rumours Villa wanting swap Bent Andy 'no goals' Carroll, cant serious #avfc 
I cant see anyone McLeish brings improve Villa plays football week week out, cant see us improving #avfc 
Who would Villa fans rather helm Alex McLeish Neil Warnock? #avfc 
I cant see Villa signing anyone else transfer window, player afford import America 2 months #mediocre 
I hear Villa looking Macron replace Nike, think current kit could change anyway, keen squares #avfc 
Fantastic finishes Villa goalscorers yesterday particular Gabbys, wonderful skill, doubt Clark replace Collins #avfc 
Cant help think Villa draw winner Man City Man Utd game next round #avfc 
Cant help think Villa improve within club dont think signings McLeish brings improve us #avfc 
Ideally Villa would sign Samba, Ba, Krancjaer, Hoillett Carrick would improve us alot thats real wishful thinking #avfc 
Demba Ba apparently £10m release clause contract, surely would good buy Villa, hes guarenteed goals #avfc 
Nedum Onouha £2.5m Jose Antonio Reyes £3m, two deals going deer either arent Villa linked #avfc 
@Football_Agent9: Celtics' Ki Sung-Yueng told advisors would like move Aston Villa January. 
@DMAC102 Hey Darragh fancy buying Mr Lerner showing us passion Villa? Our owner doesnt even watch games 
@VillaDude Lerner hired Houllier McLeish well letting go Young Milner Downing Friedal, looks opposite ambition 
"@KKFootball1: IF it's rather large if, Darren Bent departs. Villa identified Steven Fletcher possible replacement." 
@VillaDude What think Krancjaer instead, good technically spark could give us edge? 
@VillaDude I think Piennar good player, concern injury record, spends fair bit time treatment table 
Chelsea's defending Villa's 2nd absolutely terrible good defending withstanding Chelsea's pressure #avfc 
@AaronGrey90 Yea agree cant see joining Villa especially McLeish bemoaning huge wage bill 
@JeffStelling2 Great see one pundits actually standing Villa, big club never get recognition deserve 
I hear Harry Redknapp looking get rid Piennar Krancjaer create funds, would ideal targets Villa #avfc 
Paul Merson said Villa bigger club Newcastle, rolling trophy cabinet, top bloke #avfc 
@VillaDude Also turns sensation he'll go back Chelsea end season like Kyle Walker last season 
@JamesNursey Do anything rumours Villa bidding Damien Duff Fulham £1.5m? 
Alan Hutton biggest joke ever put Villa shirt, hes thug top awful footballer, deserves go #avfc 
@alrickbrown: In 20 Premier League seasons 7 teams never relegated: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Man ... 
@VillaDude Ive said ages Cahill rated, dont think hes improved all, mean Bolton near botton reason 
Would Villa fan welcome move Kris Boyd release Turkey? I see McLeish going Rangers link #avfc 
@VillaMatt How long give McLeish? The players look demotivated surely falls feet manager 
@ASTVIL123 According Micky Quinn Villa offically pub team, another overweight ex pro talking crap 
@VillaDude I hope Bolton Blackburn Wigan continue play way else trouble 
@VillaDude I think get rid January transfer window someone come bring players 
@VillaDude There pressure doubt Lerner anything especially living life America #avfc #mcleishout 
I think Villa replace Gabby Delfoneso, pace need get Liverpools defence #avfc 
I see Villa getting result today, really hope McLeish matches Liverpool today go negative like Spurs #avfc 
@talksportmdl Are actually saying something good Villa? Theres first everything 
@TimothyAbraham Is truth Villa holding talks Alan McGregor? 
Fernando Torres apparently sale 20m puts 24m spent Bent perspective would Villa fans swap Torres Bent? #avfc 
@astonvillatoday I dont think Villa fan would welcome back opened heart blues moved #bigmistake 
@VillaDude I agree Prem League sub-standard especially see players like Sturridge, Ba Carroll hyped much 
Again speaking statues Villa erect statue Dennis Mortimer holding European Cup, Tony Adams get one #avfc 
@IanTaylor7 Theres positives todays performance something us Villa fans able say lately 
Come Villa boys lets kick on, great win today Reebok promising, Up The Villa!!! #avfc 
Realisticly would Villa fans buy/loan January? #avfc
