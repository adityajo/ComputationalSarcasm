@hungerlordjr cut anyway. 
@hungerlordjr jumper declined correlation minutes. He wanted legs don't lie 
@hungerlordjr Steph historic 3. Lebron awful. Igoudala really surprised me. Hit open shots (NBA players should) bad D 
@hungerlordjr Delly needs play D league another 10 seasons starts another finals game 
@hungerlordjr also unsure. James Jones waste space. Played 30 minutes elimination game. Want cut within hour 
@hungerlordjr exactly. I wanted kill talking basketball soon step dad. Thank God Twitter, mute buttons 
@JaredKMueller @Dan_Hatman @warriors Cavs looked like best record NBA January w/ Love &amp; Irving

@hungerlordjr mozzy Iggy comical, idiot fans I kept crying Timo 
@Dan_Hatman @warriors @JaredKMueller weird, take away Igoudala Green talk great team ball. Cavs team, scum bag 
@hungerlordjr: I know Love would've hurt D Cavs started switching doubling guys really playing defense anyhow? 
@EnigmaticEvil can't wait next year, it's blind faith like w/ certain teams

@injuryexpert sitting barber last hour two following Toe Saga 2015. Consensus axe 
@thehairstore right, sounded like u said miller sub Lebron give breather, I gotcha 
@thehairstore warriors double teaming LBJ block, he's problems getting ball open shooter. Ball movement gone 
@thehairstore you're saying play Miller give Lebron breathe. Not fan matchup/in role 
@thehairstore Bogut played 2 minutes last game. Perk liability transition. No thanks 
@thehairstore tried Miller. Remember? Dunleavy 12 points minutes floor. Marion guess 5-10 mins early tomorrow 
@thehairstore who, though? Roster wasn't 12 deep Finals talents. Maybe minutes Marion, hardly seems like game changer 
@thehairstore rotations 7-8 main guys. Cavs 7, 9 before. Hard coach overcome/ predict loss 2 stars 
@thehairstore fault Shumpert Smith choking pressure 
@thehairstore managed depth needed to. Playing Delly Thompson big minutes year paid Love/Irving went 
@thehairstore putting Finals records PPG, RPG, &amp; APG, efficiency terrible, &amp; minutes insane. Needs help 
@thehairstore lebrons perimeter game disappeared playoffs. Not optimistic, 
@thehairstore don't many scoring options either way right Swish chucking bricks 
@thehairstore Cavs lot isolation, dribble, miss &amp; getting back defense. Not much GS hitting shots 
@thehairstore won 21. And warriors still close rebounding. Not sure makes sense 
@theMVJ 0.5% chance win series. Especially I'm cleveland Wednesday 
@Phelpsie88 worried. Warriors went small JR Shump look terrible

@injuryexpert unrelated question. What's outlook Kyrie Irving? Not knowledgable knee tendinitis

@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 world ATL doesn't sweep. 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 you're arguing best player league, good shooters around him. i'll bet anything 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 easily argue Cavs too. traded 3 key players January, one month ATL game 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 Cavs beat healthy Bulls team 6, w/out Kevin Love, &amp; Irving half leg. I'm worried 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 Cavs really bad January. like really bad, beat Hawks 33. 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 Cleveland beat brakes ATL Shawn Marion starting. 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 also happened.... 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 nevermind wasn't back-to-back March

@SamIngro @ScottCarasik @Sole0526 Brooklyn trash team, maybe worst ever make playoffs. 
@ScottCarasik @SamIngro @Sole0526 Korver much non-factor vs. Washington, I feel confident Cavs win series

@Nominataur @WFNYCraig The Pats won SB, got lucky, too. Maybe RW less PSI pass wouldn't INT'ed Butler? 
@Nominataur @WFNYCraig crucifying, up-in-arms moral authority mentality Twitter, people general I guess. 
@Nominataur @WFNYCraig The team broke rule should/has punished. A little excessively IMO, broke rule. My biggest issue 
@Nominataur @WFNYCraig think that's reason NE won Super Bowl, means -- 
@Nominataur @WFNYCraig Tom Brady told equipment guys make sure footballs prepared certain way, skirting on/outside rules 
@Nominataur @WFNYCraig must PSIs! 
@Nominataur @WFNYCraig Pats fumbled less soon Ridley stopped playing.

@Nominataur @WFNYCraig others too, regulation shown enforced precisely thought

@UncleRobGotNext right. Shelton would fallen Farmer didn't pick 
The Patriots got better player 32 Browns got 12, &amp; continue ask continue good, &amp; Browns good 
@BrownsBeat @JFowlerESPN won't happen

@NathanZegura: Let's goooooo! Everything could hoped table. Let's see Ray wants! Shelton parker Dupree 
@theMVJ @Browns I love you, nohomo 
@thehairstore haven't traded yet 
@FantasyGopher Why everyone keep saying WR? 
@thehairstore Charles Johnson, Mike Wallace Cordarelle Patterson top WRs. Johnson really emerged leaving Cleveland (lol) 
@frew05 paging Ray Farmer 
@BrownsBeat: Browns HAVE calling Wilkerson. 
Thank you, Ray Farmer. Browns keep picks, don't pick Mariota, &amp; hopefully won't deal Bradford now, either. 
@PFF_Sam: WR Edge Rush value first round. Bunch teams taking WR they'll BPA 
@BrownsBeat: Last minute reading pt.1 
@BrownsBeat: Last minute reading pt. 2 
Hey @DustinFox37, NT isn't position blame poor run defense. ILB/3-tech/scheme factors 
@theMVJ @ErieSteel chances happening = 0. it'd great 
@itsmazzledazzle thinking 4 year 3 next year 
@ErieSteel concerned 
@Animaleyz IMO, course 
@Animaleyz Parker won't last past 11, &amp; Gurley won't make past 14 17. That's way get guys, want 
@Animaleyz wouldn't, would picks involved. 
I see Browns trading #19 Rams pick #10 getting DeVante Parker, picking Gurley #12 
Was little surprised Gordon/Gurley mentioned Browns visits. But man, Gurley 19... not? 
@MattSteinbrink bingo, terrible supporting casts. potential enough #19, scared knee 
@BrownsBeat: Who picks 12 &amp; 19? Guess right, &amp; you'll shot free Browns Beat T-Shirt (coming May). #‚Ä¶ 
@MattSteinbrink With 2 good knees, maybe pick 19. Agree 
@LM2_28 heart attack. don't want driving traffic Browns take Mariota 
@UTKevinAcee: We officially move on. Philip Rivers told #Chargers won't traded. Extension talks ongoing.

@afc2nfc Xavier Williams good one Round7 
@afc2nfc: NEW today, I've narrowed NFL Draft 100 targets I'm giving 7 picks. Let's see I do: 
I mocked #Browns 7-round mock 
No Bradford. No Mariota. Chris Bonner QB #Browns bring next days (Round 7 UDFA). 
@brownsfrowns solid 
@Nominataur Yeah. Will interesting considering facing Gasol/Noah/Gipson/Mirotic. Mike Miller might even take warm-ups 
@Nominataur hopefully we'll see lot James 4. 
@Nominataur probably, haven't seen anything. I think Kyrie / Shumpert / Jones / James / Mozgov lineup possible. 
@BrownsBeat: Browns draft rumors end tonight, questions remain? 
One best mock drafts I've seen, although I still don't like Danny Shelton Browns, even 19 @greggabe 
@rod_johnston never said lazy, overweight 
@rod_johnston don't see first rounder. Josh Norris ranked No. 32 Justin Higdon 40s, guys I trust 
.@rod_johnston I like Manziel, I'd rather trade everything Mariota waste 1st rounder Danny Shelton 
@rod_johnston team two NT roster. Taylor Kitchen. They'll add depth point, Shelton mistake 
@rod_johnston part ILB, part scheme injuries DL. Rubin didn't play great, scheme left LBers vulnerable 
@rod_johnston speaks draft class, Shelton. He's Poe, Ngata, Wilfork, etc 
@rod_johnston run defense mostly ILB 3-4. Fans blame NT way much 
@rod_johnston overweight player benefit one good season, going overdrafted b/c there's option top draft 
@rod_johnston don't really understand defense works, you? 
@MaryKayCabot @JaredKMueller They also didn't trade 3 No. 1 picks player mixed opinions 
@BrownsBeat: Browns Draft 2015: 5 bold predictions Cleveland 
@Joshontheradio can't it, unfortunately I day job Josh. sorry. 
@JaredKMueller @sparkd12 pants pants 
@BrownsBeat: Here's 7-round #Browns mock w/ trades, QB named Mariota 
In draft news, @JoshNorris--one best business, check 2014 big board--ranked Shelton No. 32 prospect. 
@tyschalter: At @bleacherreport, I broke every team's drafting patterns tendencies since 2002 realignment: 
@afc2nfc happens every year, every year people forget last year. 
@afc2nfc @TennesseeTitans get lawn - Johnny Manziel 
@theMVJ @MyLifeAsHowie @duck0925 San Diego got expansion team year. I wasn't aware still team couple months ago 
@SamIngro @J_Walterhouse @DawgPound_DJ good idea. trade back gain additional pick use Grady Jarrett, NT Clemson 
@DawgPound_DJ @AnthonyThrives @SamIngro run defense doesn't fail succeed 1 guy. scheme. ILBs. 3-tech. NT. vital. 
@DawgPound_DJ @AnthonyThrives @SamIngro Parker since first game tape. Can't get guy like later. Can get fat NT Rd3 
@robisindy @chris_davis42 @DawgPoundNation hate lard ass 
@robisindy @chris_davis42 @DawgPoundNation one-cut bull rusher 4.6 yards contact average. maddeningly obvious 
@robisindy @chris_davis42 @DawgPoundNation Richardson pick would ideal. Oh, want trade AVG RB? *fired* 
@robisindy @chris_davis42 @DawgPoundNation fat dude got fired pretty quick pick. 
@robisindy @chris_davis42 @DawgPoundNation good counter argument Petty Brandon Weeden without rocket arm, that's scary. 
@chris_davis42 @DawgPoundNation @robisindy idea means 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation yep, teams aren't drafting earlier reason; basically throwing away pick wishing well 
@DawgPoundNation @robisindy chances panning close 0. non-issue me, concerned -- unless Bonner 
@DawgPoundNation @robisindy Browns drafted Owen Marecic 4th round. Not advocating surrender huge asset QB yr 
@DawgPoundNation @robisindy so, yeah 
@DawgPoundNation @robisindy btw, Mariota 56MPH, Winston 55 MPH Petty/Hundley 53 MPH combine (velocity) 
@DawgPoundNation @robisindy Colt McCoy? 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation Diego, I talked couple people know 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation biggest thing besides cannon arm he's cerebral, accounts great kid field. he's San 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation done lot reading player/person. reason think isn't worth 7th, tryout 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation petty grayson 4th later. chris bonner 7th round undrafted 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation i'd happy pretty much anyone Mariota Shelton. 
@DawgPound_DJ 7'0" person formally known Brendan Haywood could emerge (lol) 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation you're right! hopefully it's DeVante Parker Bud Dupree! 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation take care Rob 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation really like Brown too. Shelton 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation I could repeat phrases u used. Watched 3 guys extensively. Goldman solid 3-4 interior DL 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation love Brown is, think you're overselling versatility 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation These popular scouting phrases, don't see applying player's talent level 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation people like Mayock say "play nose" he's referring 1-tech, 2-gap 0-tech 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation makes think that? His traits don't support statement 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation I don't hate Shelton, much I don't see elite talent, selected Top 12 
@robisindy @DawgPoundNation Wouldn't like Brown high either, 3 tech No. 12? 
@DawgPoundNation @robisindy Not insane uneasonable. Hate Danny Shelton 
@BrownsBeat: Browns looking move NFL draft's top 10 | Browns Beat 
@skydancing8 @JHGrimm can't let bother -- I ignore 90% I see Twitter. I used follow people, what's point? 
@skydancing8 @JHGrimm it's people screened talk show radio, cut abruptly, without filter 
@skydancing8 @JHGrimm Twitter gross place. 
@skydancing8 @JHGrimm labeled LeBron Cavs lifeless November, Tribe done April, &amp; Manziel done 1 start. The list goes 
@Conley76 @afc2nfc @DavisMattek non-existent field 
@afc2nfc @DavisMattek mcbride looks like Massaquoi/LaFell type player. 
@afc2nfc @DavisMattek huge fan projection WRs 
@afc2nfc @DavisMattek trust Higdonia, wasn't impressed first look 
@Nominataur I read surgery necessity, either way 
@DavisMattek @afc2nfc sure you. maybe Conley Georgia 
@afc2nfc @DavisMattek Tre McBride maybe 
These "my guys" #Browns year (in order): WRs Cooper, Parker, White; DL Brown, Goodman, Shelton; OLBs Fowler, Dupree, Beasley 
@Conley76 @DawgPound_DJ anti-Carr, didn't prove anything Year 1 
@Conley76 @DawgPound_DJ I liked Mack, definitely didn't think he'd good was, early 
@Conley76 @DawgPound_DJ thought Shazier great fit, Pittsburgh hard Buckeyes 
@DawgPound_DJ @Conley76 I liked Allen Robinson lot 
@Conley76 @DawgPound_DJ liked Manziel Beckham Jr. 
@Conley76 @DawgPound_DJ that's blocked company IT 
@Conley76 getting apathetic again, it's struggle 
@DawgPound_DJ ah, wasnt sure random related. love even 
@DawgPound_DJ Baltimore? 
@Conley76 following Cavs Twitter year, Tribe Twitter far, I'm surprised Browns Twitter spiraling chaos 
@DawgPound_DJ what? 
@Conley76 really? saying that? 
@Cianaf @tyschalter @ChrisHansenNFL I'm surprised haven't muted JLC yet.

@EnigmaticEvil @BrownsBeat Not really concerned things. Just don't see high impact, Ngata/Poe type people 
@JaredKMueller I'd lot fun sweep C's home court 
@EnigmaticEvil @BrownsBeat I'd take guys Shelton 
@EnigmaticEvil @BrownsBeat Parker No. 2 WR, sure he'll 12 anymore. Big fan Eddie Goldman, Dupree, &amp; M Brown 
@EnigmaticEvil @BrownsBeat impact WR impact defender (front-7) 
@ErieSteel id like make list browns players arrange player height (no rounding). good start 
@ErieSteel you're hired

@CaneFin @Spoon_r13 @JFriel90 I watched Irving develop, he's getting better well 30 pt playoff game vs. terrible team 
@KrisMayhue @JFriel90 @Spoon_r13 disagree that. It would LeBron vs. Spurs 2007 repeat. Don't think LeBron could either. 
@Spoon_r13 @CaneFin @JFriel90 I know lot game, Kyrie is/isn't. Thanks help ;) 
@KrisMayhue @JFriel90 @Spoon_r13 could Wade lead Dion Waiters, Tyler Zeller, Jarrett Jack Tristan Thompson NBA Finals? 
@CaneFin @JFriel90 @Spoon_r13 Nope. If you're unwilling admit Wade isn't was, don't know help 
@Spoon_r13 @JFriel90 I don't feel accomplished, I don't play Cavs. Weird. 
@Spoon_r13 @JFriel90 OK? I watch Heat games televised. Wade looks nowhere near prime. 
@JFriel90 @Spoon_r13 kyrie young superstar, Wade fading. It great decision trade Wade Kyrie. 
@JFriel90 @Spoon_r13 yeah, can't respond. it's hard dispute facts. try instead homer goggles 
@Spoon_r13 @JFriel90 uninformed, like Wade shot career low 47%, outscored Kyrie. Time admit Wade declining. 
@HeatvsHaters 21 5 3, heading different directions 
@HeatvsHaters *i didn't 
@HeatvsHaters right I meant. Wade great player, u didn't watch close back then. No argument 
@FantasySportsWH fire away 
@HeatvsHaters serious? Wade great long time, it's hard decision choose rising star deteriorating one 
@FantasySportsWH @JeremySickel Not smart baseball, thanks Jeremy/FSWH 
@JFriel90 This probably one delusional Tweets I ever read. 
@ShyraMecole @JFriel90 @HeatvsHaters Kyrie &gt; Wade lol

@Conley76 @DavidLBurkart @BrownsBeat especially said picks played league one season. 
@DavidLBurkart @Conley76 @BrownsBeat reason people think deluded opinions NFL personnel management actually affect policy 
If Browns fired every GM one/two years w/out letting develop talent implement plan, they'd Browns.

@DawgsByNature @JonDBN also think it's attempt replace Gordon, w/out using high pick (might happen). Think Farmer really moved 
@NDTScouting Malcom Brown utility 3-4? Can 3-4 team justify picking Rd1? 
@FakeUrban: This bracket much better. 
@NDTScouting degree* 
@NDTScouting thanks, too. What's thoughts Henry Anderson, seems like controversial guy degrer 
@NDTScouting Danielle Hunter Rd 3 seem like good spot him?

@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 wasting anymore time him. Hated thought paying. Think Browns passing $13 mil guaranteed affirms 
@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 didn't much issue w/ Mingo tackling Skrine's. Yikes, painful watch 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 that's OK, everyone ideas. Disagree completely well 
@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 isn't asked rush passer enough true 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 Sheard doesn't fit, Browns like Mingo Kruger. Kruger better player, Mingo better coverage 
@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 good point. Need hit star one two 1st rounders, meaningful contributor 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 tendered, tendered (just like Mack, let market dictate fair price), Sheard doesn't fit fully. 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 Browns kept good players, though. 
@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 isn't great logic, wasn't FA, flawed logic 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 drafted player, failing understand matters ? 
@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 original statement Cavs bought team, Browns arent willing to. Or something. Disagree, oh well 
@ErieSteel @Browns hope one hand and... 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 I'm debating anything 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 it's debate. Irving year left contract, wasn't FA. And CLE trade team 
@JimWalker13 @brownstown1217 Kyrie extended. And Cavs drafted Bron 1 point üòâ 
@brownstown1217 @JimWalker13 didn't. Traded Moz, Love, Smith, &amp; Shump... Irving/TT drafted. LBJ drafted, technically

@DawgsByNature @DawgPoundNation Haden/Skrine rookie seasons? Despite enthusiasm give them, Farmer wisely hasn't 
@DawgsByNature @DawgPoundNation it's logic hope. Team already added 3 CBs last year anticipation losing guys like Skrine 
@DawgPoundNation @DawgsByNature weak link good scheme. They'll fine w/out Buster Skrine. 
@DawgsByNature @DawgPoundNation trolling lol 
@DawgsByNature @DawgPoundNation team unwilling match 13$ mil guaranteed telling 
@DawgsByNature @DawgPoundNation disagree adamantly 
@DawgPoundNation I believe Desir, loved since time last year. He got field ahead schedule looked good 
@DawgPoundNation remaining FA players, cuts, draft, UDFA, cuts, trades. Plenty opportunities 
@makavenne @DawgPoundNation you're actually factually wrong, neither things 
@lmj4746 @DawgPoundNation came long way raw athlete college, undersized effort player flashes sometimes

@WxShaw: @DawgPoundNation love Skrine that's big money, Sheard fit. Guys need keep have. Thomas, Haden, Mack, so‚Ä¶ 
@DawgPoundNation Skrine atrocious. Apparent team thought letting walk 13$ mil guaranteed 
@DawgPoundNation Gilbert Desir emerge, KWaun start NCB 
@DavidMTomko: @DawgPoundNation @MikeHoagJr I've got say Skrine wasn't worth money. And I think Gilbert better day 1. 
@DawgPoundNation Skrine bad. Rubin suited NT, Cameron barely played, &amp; Sheard average-good. Think they'll add pass rusher 
@DawgPoundNation I'm sure close watch guys you're worried losing, Browns won 7 w/ easy schedule 2014 
.@DawgPoundNation worse? Explain 
@LaneAdkins why'd Skrine get 13$ mil desperate team? Have busy day job, that's pretty telling 
@BrownsBeat: I don't want get caught this, could agent posturing like w/ Maclin, let's least some‚Ä¶ 
Signing Revis pretty much guarantees Hard Knocks, yeah? #Browns (think it's already lock) 
If don't want Revis cost $$$, why? It's money, Browns aren't going spend 40$ mil. front load deal 
@BrownsBeat: reporting Browns expressed interest Darrelle Revis. 
@BrownsBeat: Brian Hartline gives Browns solid passing game piece 
@Conley76 @DavidLBurkart none ever end true. Browns always rumored running top FAs 
@Conley76 @DavidLBurkart lot still TBD, might change outlook seeing signings draft visits 
@Conley76 @DavidLBurkart people think they're trading Mariota. Against it. And playing 1st rd QB next year. Use picks 
@BrownsBeat: Browns: active overspend F/A #Browns fans: team doesn't want win!! 
So, Maclin's agent probably used reported negotiations w/ #Browns get money Eagles? Shocker. Is everyone's first F/A? 
@DavidLBurkart possibly OL, probably DL. Both groups need depth. Think pass rusher drafted 
@DavidLBurkart TE big, fan draft class. Think sign someone there. And WR. Need keep adding bodies there. 
@SatchnScooby never even started taking Rubin, I think you're confusing different convo 
@SatchnScooby lol, problem I confused though. 
@SatchnScooby sure you're stuck him, he's replaceable. You/others (not Browns, they're smart enough overpay) wrong 
@SatchnScooby buster Skrine swallows 2-3 blockers? What? He one highest NFL missed tackles 
@SatchnScooby untrue, one worst tacklers NFL, beat lot. Look beyond pass deflections truth 
@afc2nfc it's right &amp; places. Getting people talking viewing website/TV matters 
@Scott4hireScott @BrownsForum going back Bengals last season. 
@Scott4hireScott @BrownsForum Hoyer 9 4th Q INTs beat 3 teams w/ winning record. To trash pile goes 
@afc2nfc I got hammered buying Richardson, people quoting Cosell it. It rough year

@LaneAdkins @DawgPoundNation ah didn't understand wording, thanks. Makes perfect sense. Rosenhaus great 
@LaneAdkins @DawgPoundNation confusing wording. The worst case scenario fact he's Hartline's agent? 
Browns Buckeyes fans' heads exploding thought Hartline Ginn would explore options outside Ohio. 
@Ryan_Riddle @PFF small, wasn't knock?

@FBALL_Andrea @VincentFrankNFL Hyde RB, Boom Herron RB2

@FirstRoundGrade yep, absolutely part game. Gurley also 5'9", 200lbs. No injury history really. ACL still carries risk

@BrettFrankel welcome aboard, Frankel, @timdlewi bailed already 
@theMVJ can't wait start f*cking hammeren people! 
@theMVJ parts unknown 
@MikeKrupka @afc2nfc @dawgpounddaily @NFLDraftZone "let's go get him!", I don't see verifies ordered GM something 
@MikeKrupka @afc2nfc @dawgpounddaily @NFLDraftZone think started Dowell's radio "wreckthisleague" interview. Jimmy may said 
@MikeKrupka @afc2nfc @dawgpounddaily @NFLDraftZone still convinced Haslam put gun head draft Manziel. 
@MikeKrupka @afc2nfc @dawgpounddaily @NFLDraftZone I wouldn't draft 1st round 
@NFLDraftZone @MikeKrupka @dawgpounddaily @afc2nfc draino I drink? 
@dawgpounddaily @afc2nfc @MikeKrupka @NFLDraftZone operates Fansided account? j/w 
@dawgpounddaily @MikeKrupka @NFLDraftZone @afc2nfc otherside what? On Mariota? Explain why, I don't see NFL throws. 
@dawgpounddaily @MikeKrupka @NFLDraftZone @afc2nfc Mariota many on-field question marks Manziel. Not impressed, changed 
@dawgpounddaily @NFLDraftZone @MikeKrupka i'd rather see Manziel play waste picks Mariota -- that's choice 
@NFLDraftZone @MikeKrupka @dawgpounddaily could trade every pick Jameis. nothing would surprise point 
@MikeKrupka @dawgpounddaily @NFLDraftZone I'd content Parker/Brown. Have liked Brown lot, would like see true NT Rd 4 
@Landgrant33 ......whut? 
@theMVJ dayyyyyyym 
@theMVJ think u gave before, link stuff? looking something CLE frame put wall playa 
@BigPZ78 one would fault that. Hard times indeed 
A fan base lost team years, well beyond apathetic today. Browns faithful wavering, there's end sight 
@Efrisco_ @theMVJ @Browns what's over/under Manziel swan rides opening day ? 
@theMVJ @Efrisco_ @Browns need evolve Browns drinking game general offseason binge drinking. We die 
@Efrisco_ @theMVJ @Browns bad Lolbanner starts looking appealing? 
@JHGrimm every time someone says process, take shot. If say play like brown, two shots 
@ChrisTrapasso Malcom Brown, DT Texas 
Starting draft "Hard Knocks: Cleveland Browns Drinking Game" rules. Stay tuned. 
.@BMeek23 @afc2nfc eventually warmed Manziel, I'll stand lol 
@afc2nfc small hands/glove thing really hurt Twitter 
@Conley76 pin stripes good look 
Is doubt #Browns new uniforms going awful? 
@PPRMonster maybe, i'd trying get paycheck I knew end near. turned 6-7 mil Browns, reportedly 
@Armando_Marsal @PPRMonster wasn't field much, won't missed badly. 1 concussion away retirement probably, @Sheddy88 
Cavs Indians definitely win title #Browns #vaultme 
@DavidLBurkart gotcha, failed give kick ass 
@DavidLBurkart deserve credit drafting Gordon? took risk 2nd round pick supplemental draft headcase 
@DavidLBurkart won't bring back he's terrible. 
@idkidk123123 @ChrisTrapasso @macb57 8-10 games he'll actually play, nope. 
@ChrisTrapasso @macb57 @idkidk123123 Cameron turned 6-7 mil #Browns, reportedly. 
@RumorsandRants @ScottCarasik oh, even fake wrestler world still think that's insane 
@RumorsandRants @ScottCarasik Tony G top 5 NFL player all-time? .... what?? 
@smartfootball contrast, Sherman makes pick - insults Revis, claims world's biggest a-hole title 
@alittamnayr blah, like DE group. Winn, Bryant, Bryant Taylor - NT needs definite upgrade. If Devante Parker available 1st.. 
@alittamnayr i'd rather draft WR, DL, OL give Manziel shot redemption trade Mariota Winston draft Grayson 
@afc2nfc What's eval DT/DE Malcom Brown? Seems like play anywhere 3-4 
@DawgsByNature: Cleveland media clamoring Hoyer return makes think Cleveland media doesn't understand QB play. 
@Borney25 @DawgsByNature them. Hoyer successful worst defenses NFL. Folded vs real competition 
@seanbarakett @steakNstiffarms also interested. Asking friend

@DanHampton8 @NFLonCBS @trentgreen10 I mean, Seattle tons PED violations since Carroll took over. Other teams too. Let's accurate 
@DanHampton8 @NFLonCBS @trentgreen10 integrity? know fact, conjecture? 
@ChrisTrapasso @RDotDeuce 3/4 TD thrown Simon 
@frew05 kearse supposed pick Butler, couldn't get line Browner insane 
@ESPNStatsInfo: Marshawn Lynch 5 previous runs 1 season scored one touchdown. 
@GregBurud: belichick knew calling timeout would convince carroll pass 2nd down, unparalleled genius ‚Ä¶ 
Maybe original, I to. Richard Sherman @RSherman_25 , mad bro?

@KeithOlbermann Keith, fault. But I hate slowly declining intelligence media, maybe society. Clicks/views &gt; content 
@KeithOlbermann @DJClaiborne basically every story week. Time magazine stories selfies, Marshawn thing joke

@afc2nfc @TDGawd watched 3 &amp; noticed 1 drop. guessing hit 4 DB? high Devin Smith til I saw Lockett run routes 
@afc2nfc @TDGawd same. also read slight issue drops hands... seeing that. 
.@TDGawd @afc2nfc Lockett size hands TY Hilton 
@afc2nfc @TDGawd watching make decent amount catches various difficulty/method. labeled "body catcher"? I'd disagree 
@afc2nfc @TDGawd watching both, I think I'm board Lockett. reminds Antonio Brown, I crazy? 
@afc2nfc @TDGawd Phillip Dorsett Tyler Lockett 
@MikeKrupka good vibes bruh 
@jordancameron: Seeing lot Seattle Seahawks gear there..don't remember people wearing 2011. 
@largebill68 could also smoke agent trying create market client. 
@mr_gause it's well beyond embarrassing point. 
Is hard believe someone would turn 6-7$ mil play #Browns ? RE: Cameron rumor 
@FBallGameplan think falls. Throwing would hurt stock even more, I understand 
@FBallGameplan tape can't make NFL throws? 
@JimPeteEHC I LOL'ed 
@JimWalker13 @lmj4746 here, disagreement, done defending josh. Just huge piling all, alcohol kush, ya know? 
@JimWalker13 @lmj4746 think problem, victim poor decisions problem. May issue want /desire 
@JimWalker13 @lmj4746 sure. But saying #Browns 6-4 quit Gordon day gets suspended, suggests isn't w great talent 
@lmj4746 doubt, diminishing good is, pretty poor rationalizing. He's great player 
Same people claim Browns better without Gordon, ones still think Brian Hoyer good QB. 
Derp ‚Äú@Mr_KevinJones: The Browns 6-4 without Josh Gordon 2014‚Äù 
Shouldn't hate Josh Gordon guys, I feel sorry him, Browns 
@falcfans businesses still do, it's company's right that. Players agree rules order work 
@BuckeyesCavsFan @CLETown_Fan hated dion every night though 
@TDGawd agreed! Doesn't break tackles gain, extend runs. Good pad level 
@TDGawd love 
@jasonrmcintyre @JasonLaCanfora McManoman hated job every day since draft. He soaking in, swimming around smugness 
@FBALL_Andrea @graham0307 @Cianaf think that's fine, sure he's guy would go that. Maybe hears crickets FA 
@graham0307 @FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf team stuck w Hoyer, made indication would play. I dislike him/think wrong preparing 
@graham0307 @FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf street. Instead, stomach games Hoyer unknown still QB 
@graham0307 @FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf lot people say that, drives insane. If played 8 games year, he'd gotten ready 
@FBALL_Andrea @graham0307 @Cianaf Hoyer played well really trash defenses, showed nothing decent competition 
@FBALL_Andrea @graham0307 @Cianaf I think that's lunacy, middle ground me. 
@FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf agree contingency 
@FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf Bortles looked bad, sure author watched highlights, Carr awful. Just disagree w/ process 
@graham0307 @FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf mean like Hoyer? 
@FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf ok disagree, oh well. Manziel spoiled brat, I couldn't care less, think it's wrong abandon soon 
@FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf relax. They sold doesn't equate "needs QB" line point. I'm glad you've long 
@FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf say Browns tied Manziel least another year, OAK JAX tied guys 
@FBALL_Andrea @Cianaf I'd cautious accepting everything guys say time year. A lot posturing misdirection 
@Cianaf @FBALL_Andrea know 1.5 games, that, Cleveland QB. Right. Noted. 
@BrownsMemes: Even Lance Stephenson trolling Bill Belichick week #DeflateGate 
@ChrisTrapasso @FO_ASchatz aggressive defense "finishes" plays certainly increases recovery chances. Coaching help

@DawgPound_DJ @KenCarman late first round NBA picks like fifth round NFL 
@PatInKent I think he's smart kid, great athlete. Definitely owns system. I haven't seen anything says he's NFL passer yet. 
@PatInKent damn, tell give job 
@PatInKent yep, &amp; LBs can't read oline. stay home RB &amp; Mariota.. o-line read counter, trap, it's backside screen 
@PatInKent D line aggressive, smart. Oregon O-line gives many different looks, they're going tested limit 
@PatInKent Oregon easily blow away Buckeyes don't play fundamental D take bait deception plays 
@MrLouise08 @McMurphyESPN watched lot Mariota tape, struggles complete NFL throws. throws uncontested, result system 
@TDGawd @NFLChurch @VincentFrankNFL hope so. Jimmy going need year two, certainly window it. This game enormous 
@TDGawd @NFLChurch @VincentFrankNFL yep, always weak links college defenses. UCLA good game plan mental lapses screwed

@VincentFrankNFL @NFLChurch podcast? Would like hear 
@Ryan_Riddle I'll check out. Have read takes Mariota's game, aren't shining reviews? 
@NFLChurch @VincentFrankNFL I thought Miami would win one, surprised

@DawgPound_DJ sorry dude, I'm joking you, good? 
@DawgPound_DJ lucky? Too drunk man, I'm out. 
@DawgPound_DJ I don't agree. Counterproductive playing journeyman QB likely won't re-sign offseason unless wins playoff game 
@DawgPound_DJ know watching full season. Can't say John. My entire point summed nicely. 
@theMVJ @DawgPound_DJ try Chargers, twice hope, triple letdown real despair junkies 
@DawgPound_DJ think Bortles grasped whole playbook? Lol 
@DawgPound_DJ Henne ahead Bortles, doubt. We disagree philosophy. I value game reps Young QB. Only way develop/evaluate 
@GregSopko it's unfortunate Hoyer couldn't guy, you're hurting. I feel brother. It'll OK eventually 
@DawgPound_DJ head coach never played wrong player before, stuck guy long? Belichick Brady played Bledsoe 
@GregSopko 7 quarters really proved wrong, haha. 
@DawgPound_DJ agree, position handled differently. Sticking sub-par player unknown potential wrong move 
@GregSopko never said that, saying he's already makes foolish. 
@DawgPound_DJ competing, trying best, matter? Hoyer talented enough win SB, keep lying yourself? 
@DawgPound_DJ 7 quarters starters. Manziel could potentially led team wins cupcakes won Hoyer starting 
@GregSopko enjoy fantasy land.

@RuiterWrongFAN @kurt13warner well, Hoyer QB, kind paradox sorts. 
Repeating "But... Brian Hoyer got Browns 7-5!" doesn't make less incorrect.

@theMVJ thought -4, may shifted... probably -17 
@theMVJ bet farm Colts soon I heard $$$$$$ 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 don't believe do, think wins stat assign one player. especially system players 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 i'm working piece work tonight (for tomorrow) Hoyer benched, 7-5 misleading. 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 much stats shape theory, mean much less w/out context 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 wondering you've watched every game. lot outside analysts don't make conclusions w/out facts 
@NateUlrichABJ ask real question that, like struggling far 3 games? 
@dougbrown8 @WFNYCraig @AndrewJTobias shih tzu's always wasting people's money 
@BMeek23 @Ryan_Riddle browns schedule helped get 7-5. Every tough front-7 faced, Hoyer crumbled w/out P/A 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 I don't think you're crying, think you're misinterpreting ultra-defensive. Have always liked stuff 
@BMeek23 @Ryan_Riddle can't put eggs stat basket either. Hoyer bad statistical QB. Much worse field stats 
@BMeek23 @Ryan_Riddle context doesn't show stats. Even splits don't fully capture factors. Numbers always mislead NFL 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 I'm sorry you're sensitive. For former NFL player that's surprising 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 A lot factors. YAC one them. If Alex Smith 38 TDs 5 thrown 5 yards. Is great QB? 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 telling I think opinion uninformed/incorrect hostile, I'm sorry feel way. Good luck 
@BMeek23 @Ryan_Riddle really, QB doesn't play defense. He could throw 3 INTs like Dalton Sunday team still win. Not win 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 every win loss attributable QB. So count either way? 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 hostility I'm challenging opinion? 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 watched every Hoyer snap? 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 no, actually, not. 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 wins QB stat. Wins QB stat. Wins QB stat!!!! 
@Ryan_Riddle @BMeek23 false. He bad times throughout year. Team carried him, way around 
@NFLChurch @jsbrownsinsider disagree, aren't much better positions.. need players contribute ways ST 
@ChrisWesseling @NFLChurch @PFF 3rd best, Rodgers Davante Adams? 
@NickCaminoWTAM: If don't think Cribbs housing one Sunday, haven't lived long. #Browns #Colts 
@NFLChurch @jsbrownsinsider Pettine said didn't room roster strictly specialist player. 
@WFNYBen unfollowed many people November. It rough month, timeline awesome 
@WFNYScott Right. I disagree came conclusion. My hot take year. 
.@LAndyman_ "9-5", defeated 3 winning teams, others combined 6 wins played Browns. Wins QB stats. Facts 
@WFNYScott What's take decision? 
@WFNYScott It doesn't happen Brian Hoyer-Brandon Weeden either, Hoyer+any combo average QBs Browns fielded. 
@MattCollinsBlog @BrownsBeat schedule changed. #perspective 
@JHGrimm I can't imagine quarterback worse Derek Anderson. Never forget 
The #Browns 7-5 BECAUSE Brian Hoyer, NOT 9-3 BECAUSE him. 
@JHGrimm I won't say Hoyer terrible Anderson, it's close 
Also, beaten 2 winning football teams starting QB. The Browns 7-5 spite Brian Hoyer, him. Dumpster fire 
Convinced Browns fans enjoy losing 
Same old Browns

@MistakesbyLake @Animaleyz jury Manziel. I said he'd solid NFL QB well draft/hype. Enjoy rooting #Browns QB 
@MistakesbyLake @Animaleyz I also rebut Brian Hoyer franchise QB. 
@MistakesbyLake @Animaleyz I can't rebut Rams didn't prevent Browns drafting Manziel, taking #2?

@theMVJ @AlbertBreer Johnny "wasn't ready" A.) Man crushing Brian Hoyer B.) A Merrill Hoge fan 
@JoshFin maybe let know prepare like going play. I'd buy 
@JoshFin possibly. hear anything increased reps Manziel throughout week, though. 
@Animaleyz agree went back farther. counting Cincy game, Hoyer borrowed time since JAX 
@ErieSteel: E.T. straight photobomb @JManziel2 #PhoneHome

@MayBNxtYrInCLE fans definitely helps. highly doubt make playoffs, good season either way. 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE that's fun entertaining, great... good team right now? ceiling? matter? 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE then, divine intervention? The AFCN easy SoS -- teams 7 wins. Not coincidence either?? 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE Ok -- back point: winning stop tougher matchups Hoyer remains limited. 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE Brandon Weeden never threw 30 incompletions loss. Probably 7-4, though. He awful player -- bar? 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE team losing hurt. "win" Hoyer. none "Hoyer wins" - QB stat 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE 9-4; don't analyze emotion. see whole body work, wins/losses (not QB stat -- it's not) 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE agree this. don't see style winning continuing postseason. solid steps made season 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE i'm sure circles frequent, gotten way benefit doubt dating back 13 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE im diminishing chances winning better teams, esp w/ Hoyer &amp; amount injuries sustained 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE face tough defense, crumbles. matters plenty. i'm diminishing Browns standing 7-4 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE wins bad teams, sure matter, lol... what? 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE even sure you're talking about. 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE really fun talking myself, good one 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE i'm making two points: you're wrong Cincy tougher matchup BUF, &amp; you're wrong Hoyer good starter 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE here's undeniable: ; 6/9 wins QB came teams combined 6-24 record. 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE I'm basing "tough matchup" solely Hoyer. BUF aggressive scheme, problem McD Schwartz game 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE fine year -- also, Rey, Vontaze Leon Hall week. 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE Hoyer awful two games vs. tough front-7 -- JAX &amp; HOU, awful last week vs. poor ATL defense 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE opinions, facts. Buffalo top 3 defense ; D problematic CLE 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE responded this, though: ... keep up? 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE i'm talking nothing w/ him, kind weird u. Front-7 vs. Browns offense, BUF toughest test far 
@MayBNxtYrInCLE @willohara22 @BrownsBeat pretty limited thinking. I'm talking X's O's &amp; player matchups slobber Hoyer? 
@willohara22 @MayBNxtYrInCLE @BrownsBeat doesn't matter better team -- matchups matter 
@willohara22 @MayBNxtYrInCLE @BrownsBeat dictate game 
@willohara22 @MayBNxtYrInCLE @BrownsBeat much tougher team, matchup wise, type offense Browns have. Their F-7 
@willohara22 @MayBNxtYrInCLE @BrownsBeat I disagree points. #SmartAss

@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation proud guy, &amp; happy covering winning football team. But kind ends there. His play lacking 
@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation I mocked Manziel #Browns , people see automatic I hate Brian Hoyer. I'm Cleveland, age... 
@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation I don't think matters really, I get lot comments &amp; e-mails wrong I. Hoyer great, I get 
@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation I advocated anything, opinion would make switch Hoyer shits bed 
@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation If #Browns lose yesterday w/ badly Hoyer played -- I definitely think discussion valid. 
@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation I said Hoyer holding back offense, &amp; lots stuff. Benching Hoyer/expecting JM win wasnt one 
@JoshFin @DawgPoundNation that's completely true. Saying Hoyer bad, wondering Manziel could do, = bench Hoyer NOW

@WillBurge IQ basketball fans seems really low. Baseball football little higher 
@lmj4746 hard see reality fan goggles 
@lmj4746 looked like hot garbage last week decent defense. Hoyer gone weeks. Enjoy time left 
@lmj4746 easy 
@dano708: Need fire Chris Grant again.

@FBALL_Andrea hard optimism seeing struggle tough front-7s. If beat ATL, Bills true measuring stick 
@FBALL_Andrea yep. Saw alot good year believe won't happen. Two first round picks won't hurt, either 
@FBALL_Andrea truth! .500 team sure, might overachieve stretch, I don't think so. hoped playoff year 
@FBALL_Andrea Original 8-8, 7-9 [mine] predictions seem pretty accurate right now. Don't see one "sure win" left schedule. 
@FBALL_Andrea 6-4 better thought possible. Rough seeing up-and-down. Couple breaks away 8-2, also 5-5, 4-6 
@FBALL_Andrea: Is Josh Gordon Enough Keep #Browns' Playoff Dreams Alive? 
.@FBALL_Andrea Injuries trenches poor QB play make tough despite return 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap get chance take look. stats pass attempt (1-10, etc) numbers. yardage 
@BrownsBeat: What #Browns final record be? Any 10-6 predictions still yesterday's debacle? 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap check stats please (spoiler altert: throws short) 
@Soul914 don't need defend credibility -- i'm student game. I'm sorry player crush isn't good. 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap said eval wrong short passing stats (lowest YPA NFL) -- clearly wrong on. 
@Soul914 joking 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap can't win you're even smart enough know you're debating. waste time, thanks bye bye! 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap really struggling comprehend this? chart simply shows he's dead last YPA. told wrong 
@Soul914 strong arm, bad decision-making, breaks mechanics pressured. benefits short-passing game, college 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap -- there's NFL you, maybe missed one - try keep 
@Soul914 @NU_Gap numbers off? LOL! watch games 
@Soul914 oh, look this. lowest yards-per-attempt NFL? .. Get kid 
@Soul914 Greg @NU_Gap me: ... Read learn something. 
If want cheer feel-good story, = #Browns 2014 season far, go ahead. I support winning Super Bowl. Hoyer gone IMO 
@Soul914 Horrible player benefit short screen game, &amp; still NFL. Breaks pressure. Your knowledge lacking, please stop 
@birdinahand @BrownsBeat he's awful 
@RustyFlynn close. Try 
Derek Carr shitting pants year long; awful today. A lot Browns fans wanted draft him. What's lesson here, kids? 
When Browns win, say Hoyer great give credit. When clearly struggles make excuses blame team.

@graham0307 plus w/ amount deep shots Shanahan taken Hoyer year, could easily explode huge first game 
@graham0307 think minimal "rust," steps back field. good player/athlete 
@graham0307 Gordon always played way. drops, big plays outweigh poor ones. think chip shoulder could help 
@graham0307 great matchup vs. Atlanta. think 8-10 targets 5-6 catches 80-100 yards good projection 
@graham0307 coach speak. JG transcendent talent. opens offense, make immediate impact

@Bumblyjack @JoshFin @MikeKrupka agreed. glad see rational discussion not, "blarrghhhhh feeeedd thheeee crowwwwwww" ! 
@JoshFin @MikeKrupka @Bumblyjack West &amp; Crowell haven't done anything prove Tate's struggles aren't _AT LEAST_ partially due Mack loss 
@JoshFin @twithersAP weird Love looked around afterwards. Made look like making sure one saw. No one care either way 
Cribbs great return specialist. Luckily #Browns solid department won't signing him. Oh, wait... 
@PatInKent Spartans beat home OSU killed Oregon, two good teams schedule. signature win Nebraska? come 
@PatInKent loss ASU ND beating themselves, chance win Robinson dropped pass pick-6. score accurate 
@PatInKent disputable loss FSU -- No. 3 team. wacky loss No. 6 team -- others ahead w/ multiple losses (4 lost unranked teams)

@Laribus77 back turned held guy, wasn't holding. pass interference, clearly.

@Forester2927 played West, naturally got Browns 4 yard line Tate goes TD 
@Forester2927 one. Carson QB1. RG3 Rivers bye

@samanthabunten there? 
@alittamnayr @TrentNoble16 @JasonLaCanfora plus , it's traditional WCO. He takes many chances vertically, P/A helping 
@alittamnayr @TrentNoble16 @JasonLaCanfora scheme helped alot. Shanahan spreads ball around well. Maximizes ability. 
@BrownsBeat: WR Rodney Smith (6'5, 220lbs) FSU active Browns Hawkins tonight. That's big man. 
@BrownsBeat: Hoyer finds way win tonight. Running game dominates, Browns win 23-20. I don't know why, I feeling. 
@BrownsBeat: Here #Browns inactives: WR A Hawkins, CBs J Bademosi, R Nelson &amp; P Desir, RB G Winston, OL V Painter &amp; TE J Cameron 
@TrentNoble16 @JasonLaCanfora said lol 
@TrentNoble16 @JasonLaCanfora Hoyer play it. There excuses, It's bottom line business. Franchise QBs find way 
@TrentNoble16 @JasonLaCanfora please. The situation dire seems. Dray playing really well. Mack true big loss 
.@JasonLaCanfora @TrentNoble16 truly false. Miles Austin played well. Jim Dray caught everything. Gabriel emerging. You get paid? 
@FtblSickness k. I mean it's NFL, every game "referendum", win lose jobs play. No excuses. 
@JFowlerESPN: DL Phil Taylor active Browns. Former first-rounder returns missing four games. 
@FtblSickness referendum whom? Hoyer team? 
Browns without Hawkins, Mack, Gordon Cameron. Going uphill battle sure tonight. 
@BrownsBeat: So much that. Andrew Hawkins inactive tonight, per @AdamSchefter 
@theMVJ plenty blowing, either way. #HoyerNation 
@WFNYScott I didn't know happening. I'm really surprised though. 
@WillBurge @wtam1100 @DreKnott I remember watching Jim Sorgi frm middle east 4 am, praying could beat Titans. No prayer big ebough 
@WFNYScott tweet convo belie I'm referring to, I like guy normally 
@WillBurge @wtam1100 @DreKnott 29 48, 4 INTs. Good ole Horseballs 
@WillBurge @wtam1100 @DreKnott Dec 23, 2007. Never forget, Derek "Meltdown" Anderson 
@WFNYScott good point. I'm basketball writer, happy good team watch. Not big Twitter convos either I follow 
@WFNYScott @jenmonroe @WFNYJacob Im talking writers &amp; media personalities too. Some make living stiring pot, others surprised 
@WFNYScott @jenmonroe @WFNYJacob people expecting title year one, 65+ wins delusional. Title possible, come on... Ya know? 
@WFNYScott @jenmonroe @WFNYJacob general tweets I've seen lot people, jerkoffs, really surprising &amp; knee-jerk 
@Soul914 hoping makes interesting taking team playoffs, it's going uphill fight lose ton. &amp; plays poorly 
@Soul914 throws definitely off. He really plays better rhythm (who doesn't?). Harder w/out working run game sure 
@DawgsByNature @Bumblyjack @iRepCleveland @BrendanLeister @RyInCBus Tate marginal last three games. West much better 
@Soul914 now, can't pull him, agree. Believe reached high point, though, struggling last games 
@jenmonroe @WFNYScott @WFNYJacob safe say Cavs Twitter worst three major sports Cleveland? 
@BrownsBeat: Andrew Hawkins warming shorts 'looks good', per multiple reports. Hawk make big difference field ‚Ä¶

@2QBFFB thinking Martavis Bryant could bottom soon Big Ben stops record-setting play. sure 
@2QBFFB really, Rashad, Rivers, Keenan Allen bench. Tate guy I afford lose -- maybe K Allen, he's tricky 
@2QBFFB Carson tough stretch coming up, RGIII much 
@FtblSickness @raydeaner agreed. He dogging practice blowing defenses last season. innate talent beats hard work sometimes 
@2QBFFB Rivers, RGIII, Carson 
@2QBFFB truth. 5-4 (lost 2) &amp; 1GB leader, lacking points, 5th. I could drop RGIII Tate Vick, must-win week 
@2QBFFB trade deadline last week, lost 
@2QBFFB one responds trades, play tonight. give shot 
@2QBFFB drop pick-up Vick? Ben Tate, T West real options. Hate Cleveland backfield right 
@2QBFFB feeling Vick week 2QB? Deciding him, Kevlin Benjamin, Terrance West Martavis Bryant (playing 3)
