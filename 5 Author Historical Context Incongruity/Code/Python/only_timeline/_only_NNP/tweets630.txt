somewhat silly yet awesome time XD 
well, shapes... I meant ruler shapes, DRAW SHAPES. Makes sense? XD 
@OurWorldcomic Exactly. It doesn't help all. For compositions, yes, characters much. I looking proper learning material 
@OurWorldcomic I spent time reading vanishing points cross-reference, rule third...etc. For Backgrounds, etc. 
@OurWorldcomic Most art static, without dynamic. Mostly posed, I don't know do. My mind shuts there... 
@OurWorldcomic did. It's nice. And proves I lack sort creativity, I compare gift. 
@OurWorldcomic oh my...

Lets try way - Lesson learned. No future “Photosets” XD 
Photo: I don’t know this…&gt;_o; First time drawing one XD Oh, first actual post... 
@Chalodillo That's reason enough, right XD 
@Fyxefox maybe looking visual reference helps. Image Sites, posing oneself front mirror (I DON'T latter XD) 
@Scapponess And say British hard time XD Why always Indians answering phones now? Do require less payment? 
@Scapponess yeah..true enough. Will give shot. And make account isn't necessarily known co-workers family. XD 
@Avencri @thief8 *whistles* nice XD
