@Jason__Dill sign him. Can't worse Beltran right 
@Jason__Dill seeing one Monaco/Leverkusen semis Real/Barca/Bayern would throw things whack 
@Jason__Dill point, depends draw. We could see Real/Barca quarterfinal Monaco/Leverkusen possible... well 
@Jason__Dill get healthy sort James/Bale/Isco rotation, they're good anybody 
@Jason__Dill Bale/Casillas/Ancelotti dilemma get better gets worse, though 
@Jason__Dill Barca probably would second pick. Their counter attack shred anybody 
@Jason__Dill it's gotta @FCBayernEN. Incredibly deep well-rounded. Top-flight manager keeper 
@Jason__Dill ...That one entertaining games I've seen months. Nonstop action, minor fighting, Chelsea implosion 
@Jason__Dill Bayern game wasn't even worth watching penalty. I watched Chelsea/PSG game bell bell......

@darrenrovell looks like Chris Paul LeBron 
@espn_nfceast @NotoriousOHM ehh...LB huge deal NYG. Base defense usually 5 DBs anyway 
I really wanna see Daniel Bryan go running CNN newsroom yelling "NO! NO!" waving arms frantically

Holy Danny Amendola batman 
@espn_nfceast Deadspin called Dan 
@espn_nfceast No, it's obvious you're USFL guy want NFL fail 
@DanOrlandoXLJ Fair point. My issue nobody ever 'tries' kneel downs. O-linemen ripe knee injury case 
@MikeGarafolo @DanOrlandoXLJ Arizona running ball. The Giants kneeling. BIG difference 
@espn_nfceast: Cowboys looked good, huh? Good thing won Super Bowl last week, else you'd worry. 
#FF really good football insight @nfldraftscout @Ryan_Riddle @TDESPN @MoveTheSticks @giantswfan @espn_nfceast 
@JasonLaCanfora awfully quiet O's tonight... 
Related note: there's one Cowboy I wish played Giants, it'd Jason Witten. Tough nails. Hope can't go tonight, though 
@JasonLaCanfora Settle down, big guy 
Ahem, @thehoss41 @JasonLaCanfora Bryant McKinnie's agent told agreed restructured deal McKinnie remain Raven 
Gonna miss Tollefson, can't wait see Ojomo Tracy learn Tuck, Osi, JPP Kiwi
