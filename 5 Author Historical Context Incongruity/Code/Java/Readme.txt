All the Java projects are to be run after the Python code for respective java codes are run. The python codes generate files that are input to the java code. These java projects take sentences from different locations and output numerical values into files which are used by other python codes to get an output (Sarcastic or Non-sarcastic). We describe the projects below and line by line comments are included in the codes that need to referred. 

#
NOTE: In all the projects the user only need to change the path of the files in /src/SentencePredictor/SentimentSentence.java
Only this file should be opened if needed.

BELOW IS THE DESCRIPTION FOR EACH PROJECT -

onlyglobalSentiPredict- Takes a input as the NNP matching tweets from twitter and gives the total positive sentiment, negative sentiment and total number tweets. This is not included in the paper. We did this as an experiment while working through the project.


SentiPredict - Takes input as the test tweets and gives the number of flips. This is read by a python code and the results are saved to a file.
