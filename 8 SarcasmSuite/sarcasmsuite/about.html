Sarcasm Suite is a collection of sarcasm detection and generation modules. First created as a AAAI-17 demonstration submission, Sarcasm Suite is a deployment of four of our papers in computational sarcasm:<br>
<br>

1) Sarcasm detector for sentiment-bearing sentences: This detector is expected to work for sarcastic sentences bearing sentiment. The classifier uses features based on a linguistic concept called context incongruity. For example, 'I love being ignored'. This work was reported in our paper: Aditya Joshi, Vinita Sharma, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, '<a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/papers/acl15-sarcasm.pdf">Harnessing context incongruity for sarcasm detection</a>', ACL-IJCNLP 2015.<br>
<br><br>
2) Sarcasm detector for non-sentiment-bearing sentences: This detector is expected to work for sarcastic sentences that may not bear sentiment. It uses features based on word embedding similarities between words. For example, 'A man needs a woman like a fish needs bicycle' is incongruent (and hence, sarcastic) because of the distance between `fish' and `bicycle'. This work was reported in our paper: Aditya Joshi, Vaibhav Tripathi, Kevin Patel, Pushpak Bhattacharyya and Mark J Carman, '<a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/papers/emnlp16-sarcasm.pdf">Are Word Embedding-based Features Useful for Sarcasm Detection?</a>'. EMNLP 2016. (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602639/how-vector-space-mathematics-helps-machines-spot-sarcasm/">Related Article</a>)
<br><br>
3) Sarcasm detector that uses historical context of the author: This detector is a rule-based system that aims to capture hyperbolic sarcasm. So, if a user says 'X is the best Presidential candidate we have ever seen', this detector looks up the user's twitter timeline to determine their sentiment towards the given person X, and predicts sarcasm. This work was reported in our paper: Anupam Khattri, Aditya Joshi, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Mark J Carman, <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~adityaj/wassa15-aditya-sarcasmhistory.pdf">Your sentiment precedes you: Using an author's historical tweets to predict sarcasm</a>', WASSA workshop at EMNLP 2015.
<br><br>
4) Sarcasm detector that uses conversational context: This detector is a supervised classification system that takes into account sequential nature of a conversation, in order to predict sarcasm. This detector takes as input a conversation (a series of utterances), and predicts sarcasm in each utterance using a sequence labeling algorithm, and a set of features. This work was reported in our paper: Aditya Joshi, Vaibhav Tripathi, Pushpak Bhattacharyya and Mark J Carman, '<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/K/K16/K16-1015.pdf">Harnessing Sequence Labeling for Sarcasm Detection in Dialogue from TV Series Friends</a>', CONLL 2016.
<br><br>
5) Sarcasm Generator: SarcasmBot is an innovative, open-source (github link in the paper) chatbot module that generates sarcastic responses to a user input. It is a rule-based sarcasm generator that implements eight forms of sarcastic expressions. This work was reported in our paper: Aditya Joshi, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Mark J Carman, '<a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~adityaj/sarcasmbot-wisdom15-kdd.pdf">SarcasmBot: An open-source sarcasm-generation module for chatbots</a>', WISDOM Workshop at SIGKDD 2015.
