Chandler: (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.	yes
Rachel: (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.	yes
Monica: I swear you said you had the keys.	neither
Rachel: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.	neither

Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go. (They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)	yes

Phoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?	neither
Joey: The bigger half.	neither
Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.	yes
All: That's so sweet.	yes
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.	yes
Rachel: And a crappy New Year.	yes

Rachel: (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my &quot;In case of emergency&quot; person?	neither

Ross: No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.	neither
Joey: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.	neither

Chandler: What are you crazy? That's a baby!	neither
Joey: He should take the sack?	neither
Ross: Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.	neither
Chandler: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.	neither
Joey: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. (Feeling a little better, Ross fetches more coffee.)	?

Chandler: There it is! So what're you gonna do?	neither
Joey: What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.	neither
Chandler: And your friend Phoebe?	neither
Joey: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?	neither
Chandler: Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit. (Joey gestures to show that he wouldn't dare...)	yes
[Scene: The Hospital, Monica and Rachel are waiting for the doctors to arrive. &nbsp; They enter and are played by Noah Wyle and George Clooney.] Dr. Mitchell: ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.

Monica: Uh, you left out the stupid part.	neither
Rachel: Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said &quot;yes.&quot;	neither
Monica: I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.	neither
Rachel: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!	neither
Chandler: Alright, what have we learned so far? (There is a knock at the door. Someone turns the music off, then the whole party runs and hides, except for Monica and Rachel who answer their door. Ross stands in the doorway, holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that it's him.) The Whole Party: (Jumping up) SURPRISE!!! (Ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. The box takes off, then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. Ross is not pleased.)	neither
Ross: What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.	neither
Rachel: Was that the cake?	neither
Ross: Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.	neither
Monica: Come on, she'll be here any minute. (The whole party gathers round as Ross puts the box on the coffee table.)	neither

Monica: Oh...	neither
Chandler: (Reading) &quot;Happy Birthday Peehe.&quot;	neither

Ross: Oh, we just... Phoebe's Friends: (Finally noticing the guest of honour) Surprise!	neither
Phoebe: (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey? (The party falls flat. Chandler tries to think of a witticism, but even he can't help...)	happy
Chandler: Did you see Betty? (Betty waggles her fingers to say &quot;Hi&quot;, but Phoebe feels her birthday has been ruined by her twin.)	neither
[Scene: A Restaurant, Ross is having lunch with his father who is examining his next forkful.] Mr. Geller: I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say &quot;get out of my office!&quot;	neither
Ross: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? Mr. Geller: I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;	neither
Ross: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, &quot;Oh my god I'm gonna be a father&quot; kind of a thing? Mr. Geller: No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?	neither
Ross: No, no, Dad, I was just wondering. Mr. Geller: 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?	neither
Ross: Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father? Mr. Geller: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. (Ross is so moved by his father's charming story, that he stops eating.) Mr. Geller: So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?	neither
Ross: No, we can go to Williamsburg. Mr. Geller: Eat your fish.	neither

Monica: Hi, Geoffrey.	neither
Rachel: Hi. Dr. Rosen: Ah here, we brought wine. Dr. Mitchell: Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?	neither
Rachel: Oh, that's great. Look at that. Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, how's the ankle?	neither
Monica: It's uh... (Rachel discreetly coughs to warn her.) Monica (as Rachel): ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle. Rachel (as Monica): You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... (They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT! (Rachel joins Monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. Rachel checks that the doctors aren't listening, then lowers her voice anyway.)	neither
Rachel: Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.	neither
Monica: It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.	neither
Rachel: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?	neither
Monica: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay? (Back at the couch, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Rosen have concerns of their own.) Dr. Mitchell: So? Dr. Rosen: So... they sss-still seem normal. Dr. Mitchell: That's because they are. Dr. Rosen: (Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into... Dr. Mitchell: Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this. (Dr. Rosen obeys.) (Meanwhile, back at the sink.)	neither
Monica: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.	neither
Rachel: (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...	neither
Monica: Sure, every time, you're such a princess...	yes
Rachel: You know what?	neither
Monica: What?	neither
Rachel: You know what?	neither
Monica: What!?	neither
Rachel: You know what?	neither
Monica: (getting angry) What!!?	neither
Rachel: Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. (Rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an open-mouthed Monica in her wake.)	neither
Rachel: Hello! Here we go! Dr. Rosen: This is a great place. How long have you lived here?	neither
Rachel: (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. (Rachel tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair.) Dr. Mitchell: Really?	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus? Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, what do you do?	neither
Rachel: (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown. Dr. Rosen: Good for you.	neither
Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do. Dr. Rosen: This hummus is great. Dr. Mitchell: God bless the chickpea.	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it! (The doctors don't know what to make of all this.)	neither
Rachel: (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.	neither
Rachel: (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that! (Rachel lets her anger show too. Hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. The telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. Finally both guys jump up, and Michael wins.) Dr. Mitchell: (on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you... (Monica glares triumphantly across the room, scaring Rachel who also stands up.)	neither
Rachel: Would you excuse me for a second?	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed. (Completely undone by Monica's verbal destruction, Rachel almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr. Mitchell looks philosophically at Dr. Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar.) Commercial Break	neither

Rachel: (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing &quot;You are...&quot;) ...dead! (Monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until she's distracted by Marcel as he clambers all over her nice furniture.)	neither
Monica: Ross, he's got the remote again.	neither
Ross: Good. Maybe he can switch it back. (Marcel changes channel to Bugs Bunny, who is speaking in Spanish.)	neither
Ross: Maybe not. (Meanwhile, Rachel has taken another call, from a nurse she'd hoped never to hear from again.)	neither
Rachel: Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here. (All animosity forgotten, Rachel holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to her friend, who stands up in concern.)	neither
Rachel: It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god... Rachel and Monica: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?	neither
Monica: I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!	neither
Rachel: Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.	neither
Monica: (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)	neither
Rachel: What?	neither
Monica: We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.	neither
Rachel: Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.	neither
Monica: Thank you.	neither
Rachel: Okay, let me just change.	neither
Monica: Yes. (Rachel goes to her room.)	neither
Joey: (entering quietly) Hey. Ross and Chandler: Hey!	neither
Monica: Hi.	neither
Phoebe: Trouble?	neither
Joey: Your sister stood me up the other night.	sad
Phoebe: Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?	neither
Ross: Well did you try calling her?	neither
Joey: I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off. (Phoebe wants to be angry with Joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain and disbelief, she knows that it isn't his fault.)	neither

Phoebe: Hey. (Ursula turns in surprise.)	neither
Ursula: Oh!	neither
Phoebe: Um you, you got a minute?	neither
Ursula: Um, yeah, I'm just... (waving dismissively at the concept) ..working. (Ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down. Departing customers walk right past the pair. Sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman looks most annoyed as Ursula sets his meal down in front of her. The girls sit.)	neither
Phoebe: So.	neither
Ursula: Uh-huh. (Ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years. Phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.)	neither
Phoebe: Um, oh, I got you a birthday present. (Ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while Phoebe removes a present from her bag.)	neither

Ursula: Right... Oh, I got something for you, too. (Ursula gets up to fetch a box from her bag by the counter.)	neither
Phoebe: How'd you know I was coming?	neither
Ursula: Um, yeah, um, twin thing. (Ursula puts the box directly into Phoebe's hand. Phoebe brightens.)	neither
Phoebe: I can't believe you did this. (Phoebe opens the box, to find something familiar inside.)	neither
Phoebe: I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this. (Phoebe's smile hardens as she packs the cardigan away.)	neither
Phoebe: So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?	neither
Ursula: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over. (Ursula resumes eating her lunch..)	neither

Ursula: Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her food) Do you want some chicken?	neither
Phoebe: No. No food with a face.	neither
Ursula: You have not changed! (Ursula's eyes dance as she laughs and smiles, simply glad to be back with her sister.)	neither
Phoebe: Yeah, you too. (Trying not to wrinkle her nose, Phoebe smiles back realising it's down to her to make up for her negligent sister. Meanwhile, Ursula still hasn't received her side salad, but when she attempts to attract the waiter's attention, he ignores her.)	neither

Rachel: (as Monica) Hi, remember us?	neither
Nurse: (Grimacing) Mmm hmmm.	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...	neither
Nurse: You're that stupid.	neither
Monica: (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)	neither

Rachel: (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either. (The girls escape with a new form.)	neither
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is neglecting the game of Scrabble, for he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters about.]	0
Chandler: Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.	neither
Ross: Uh-huh.	neither
Chandler: Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.	neither
Ross: Do you have a point?	neither
Chandler: You know, you think I would. (Instead of scampering, Marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.)	?
Chandler: What's up with the simian?	neither
Ross: It's just a fur ball.	neither
Chandler: Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?	neither

Rachel: Oh. (..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and Ross and Chandler whip around once more. Monica and Rachel recoil slightly.)	neither
Nurse: Excuse me... This hospital is for people!	neither
Ross: Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart! (Ross's vigorous protest is attracting attention.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is playing &quot;She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not&quot; with the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.]	0
Phoebe: (as Ursula) Hey.	neither
Joey: Urse... (Phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.)	neither

Joey: I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge? (Phoebe is almost thrown by this.)	neither
Phoebe: (as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!	neither
Joey: You don't drink.	neither
Phoebe: (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!	neither
Joey: Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)	neither
Phoebe: (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.	neither
Joey: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?	neither
Phoebe: (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?	neither
Joey: (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.	neither
Phoebe: (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.	neither
Joey: Then, uh, then I'm sorry. (He sinks to the sofa, saddened by Ursula's ultimatum, while Phoebe follows, touched by Joey's good heart.)	neither
Phoebe: (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.	neither
Joey: I know... (He looks up at her face and Phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. Joey's voice becomes soft and warm.)	neither
Joey: I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.	neither
Phoebe: Really? (Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts &quot;Oh, whoa!!&quot; to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. A thoughtful Joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...)	neither
Joey: Pheebs?	neither
Phoebe: (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)	neither

Phoebe: Is he alright?	neither
Ross: Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.	neither

Chandler: (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?	neither
Ross: No, why?	neither
Chandler: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad. (Ross does approve of this, but he's still not sure. The tiny figure stirs.)	neither
Monica: Oh, look, he's waking up!	neither
Ross: (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing? (All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad!) Closing Credits	0

I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel?

Rachel: I know, I know, I'm sorry-	neither
Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.	yes

Ross: You called Animal Control?	neither
Rachel: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?	neither

Luisa: (Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?	neither
Rachel: Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)	neither
Ross: Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.	neither
Rachel: Turned out it was a hat.	neither
Ross: Cat!	neither
Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat! (Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)	neither
Monica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.	neither
Luisa: Marcel?	neither

Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?	yes

Rachel: Yes!!	neither
Luisa: You have no idea who I am, do you.	neither
Monica: No, none at all.	neither
Rachel: None.	neither
Luisa: Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?	neither
Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!	neither
Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch!	neither
Rachel: What?!	neither
Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?	neither
Luisa: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)	neither

Joey: Oh. Then, no. (Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend) Woman No. 2: Did I put too much rum in here? (Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances) Woman No. 1: Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She starts to shut the door)	neither
Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.	neither
Joey: Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?	neither
Chandler: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.	neither
Joey: We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out. (The women quickly shut the door)	neither
Chandler: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.	neither

Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?	neither
Phoebe: Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.	neither

Rachel: Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!	yes
Ross: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!	yes
Rachel: Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.	neither
Ross: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...	yes

Rachel: That'd be good.	neither
Ross: Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.

She was like, &quot;Oh my god.&quot; So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh!

MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?	neither
JOEY: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.	neither

ROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.	neither

PHOEBE: Yeah, I just don't buy it.	neither
ROSS: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.	neither
PHOEBE: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.	neither
ROSS: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?	neither

RACHEL: What?	neither
MONICA: Hide the Lamp.	neither
RACHEL: Monica, let it go.	neither
MONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?	neither
RACHEL: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.	neither
PHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.	yes
ROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.	neither
PHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.	neither
ROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.	neither
PHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?	neither
ROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.	neither
PHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.	neither
ROSS: What?	neither
PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?	neither
RACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.	neither
MONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.	neither

MONICA: Phoebe, tell her!	neither
PHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.	neither
RACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.	neither
CHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.	yes
RACHEL: Ok, you win.	neither
MONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.	neither
CHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.	neither
PHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?	neither
CHANDLER: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. &quot;Run away from Crazy Snake Man,&quot; they'll shout!	neither
MONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.	neither
CHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.	neither
RACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.	yes
MONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.	yes

MONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.	neither
CHANDLER: In a bad way?	neither
MONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.	yes
RACHEL: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.	neither
PHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!	neither
MONICA: You made it!	neither
PHOEBE: You're there!	neither
RACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!	neither
CHANDLER: Whoa! Don't know about that.	neither
RACHEL: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?	yes
MONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.	neither
RACHEL: Thank you.	neither
MONICA: That's fine.	neither
CHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.	neither
JOEY: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?	neither
CHANDLER: I'll take that.	neither
JOEY: You want his yearbook?	neither
CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.	neither
MONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.	neither
RACHEL: It's really not that big!	neither
CHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?	neither
JOEY: Oh, yeah.	neither
ROSS: You comin'?	neither
CHANDLER: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.	yes
ALISON: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see &quot;Philosopher wanted&quot;?	neither
CHANDLER: Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)

ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for?	yes
CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. (MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE): Here comes the beep, you know what to do.	neither
JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again.

CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.	yes
ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, &quot;hey, you're not Bob.&quot;	neither
CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.	yes
ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.	neither
CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. (At Monica and Rachel's)	yes

PHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?	neither
RACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?	neither
JOEY: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying &quot;let's go here, let's go there&quot;. Like we can afford to go here and there.	neither
PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.	neither

JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.	yes
MONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.	neither
JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)	yes
ROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.	neither
CHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.	neither
ROSS: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.	neither
CHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.	neither

CHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?	neither
ROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?	neither
CHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.	neither
ROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?	?

PHOEBE: Not for you.	neither
MONICA: All right, what's goin' on?	neither

CHANDLER: We can talk about that.	neither
PHOEBE: Well, then...Let's.	neither
ROSS: I, I just never think of money as an issue.	neither
RACHEL: That's 'cause you have it.	neither
ROSS: That's a good point.	neither
CHANDLER: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?	neither
JOEY: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.	neither
ROSS: Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?	neither
RACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.	neither
MONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.	neither
ROSS: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?	neither
CHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.	neither

MONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.	neither
ROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?	neither
CHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.	neither
ROSS: Come on.	neither

MONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.	neither
PHOEBE: So...Thank you.	neither
ROSS: Could you be less enthused?	?

MONICA: Charity?	neither
ROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.	neither
RACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.	neither
PHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.	neither
ROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.	neither
CHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.	neither
JOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.	neither
RACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.	neither
PHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.	neither

MONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.	neither
PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.	neither
CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?	yes
MONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.	neither

CHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?	neither
JADE: Eh.	neither
CHANDLER: Eh?	neither
JADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	neither
CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.	neither
JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.	neither
ROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?	neither
CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.	neither
JADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? (at the concert)	neither
MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.	neither
ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.	neither
CHANDLER: So, let's go.	neither
ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	neither
CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.	neither
MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time. (at Monica and Rachel's)	neither

PHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?	neither
MONICA: No, I just, I fell down.	neither
RACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?	neither
MONICA: You know, a party, or--	neither
RACHEL: What party?	neither
ROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.	neither
JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?	neither
CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.	neither
RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?	neither
MONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.	neither
RACHEL: Oh!	neither
PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, &quot;hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck&quot;.	neither
ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.	neither
RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program? (Monica's pager goes off)	yes
MONICA: It's work.	neither
CHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.	neither
JOEY: And we don't work hard?	neither
MONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.	neither

CHANDLER: Yes.	neither
RACHEL: Oh!	neither
CHANDLER: No.	neither
MONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.	neither
PHOEBE: Oh. (Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)	neither
WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.	neither

MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.	0
JADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

PHOE: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.	neither
JOEY: And what did he say?	neither
PHOE: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.	neither
JOEY: Wow.	neither
PHOE: Yeah, so I said, &quot;OK, relax please,&quot; y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.	neither
JOEY: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.	neither

RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?	neither
ROSS: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.	neither

MNCA: All right. Mmm-mmm. [She tastes it, and obviously hates it.]	neither
RTST: Yeah?	neither
MNCA: [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.	neither
RTST: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.	0
MNCA: [still chewing] Mmm-mmm.	0

ROSS: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.	neither
JOEY: You could say that.	yes
ROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.	neither
CHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?	neither
ROSS: I don't know.	neither
JOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.	neither

JOEY: [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?	neither
ROSS: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.	sad

ROSS: Hey, someone order a coat?	neither
RACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.	neither
ROSS: He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?	neither
CHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.	neither
RACH: And I'm in it? Then let me read it. CHAN, JOEY, ROSS: No!	neither
RACH: Come on.	neither
JOEY: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her? [Ross and Chandler stare angrily at Joey, who thinks he has come up with a good idea.]	neither
CHAN: [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] &quot;It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.&quot;	neither
ROSS: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.	neither
RACH: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.	neither
ROSS: No, you don't.	neither
RACH: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]	neither

CHAN: Good luck. [Chandler and Joey leave quickly.]	yes
ROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?	neither
RACH: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?	neither
ROSS: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type &quot;little&quot;, the idiot.	neither
RACH: Just a waitress?	neither
ROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?	neither
RACH: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles! [Rachel leaves, and Ross follows her into the hall.]	neither
ROSS: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.	neither
RACH: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress. [She goes into her apartment and slams the door.]	neither

RACH: No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.	neither
ROSS: Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.	neither
RACH: [near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.	sad
ROSS: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.	neither
RACH: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!	yes
ROSS: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.	neither
RACH: Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list. [She closes the door in his face. Ross walks sullenly back to the couch and sits down. A moment of silence ensues.]	neither
JOEY: [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer.	neither

RTST: Doesn't matter.	neither
MNCA: What?	neither
RTST: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.	neither

MNCA: Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music? [Monica turns on the radio.]	neither

(With or Without You plays) [Rachel seems touched. She pauses for a moment, then picks up the phone and starts to dial. Cut to Ross at his apartment.]	neither
RADIO: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.	yes
[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]	0
RTST: Hi, thanks for coming in again.	neither
MNCA: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.	neither
RTST: It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called &quot;fishtachios&quot;. They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?	neither

CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.	yes
JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.	neither

ROSS: As in, &quot;I now pronounce you wife and wife&quot; married?	neither
CAROL: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.	neither
ROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.	neither
CAROL: Look I just thought that...	neither
ROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!	yes
SUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?	neither
ROSS: Mmm hmmm.	neither
CAROL: Want us to go?	neither
ROSS: Uh-huh. [at Rachel and Monica's]	neither
ROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.	happy

MONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. ROSS, CHANDLER &amp; JOEY: Yes!	neither
MONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?	neither
ROSS: Would it matter?	neither
MONICA: Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!	happy
JOEY: Are you really not going?	neither
ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?	neither
MONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.	neither
ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.	neither
CHANDLER: [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.	yes
MONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.	neither
ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.	neither
JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.	yes
RACHEL: [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?	neither
JOEY: No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.	neither
CHANDLER: Whoa, she's pretty.	neither
JOEY: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.	neither
RACHEL: I'm sorry, what?	neither
MONICA: What?	neither
JOEY: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.	neither
CHANDLER: Oh, ok.	neither
JOEY: There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] &quot;Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. MRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?	neither
JOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.	neither

PHOEBE: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.	neither
ROSS: Oh my god.	sad
CHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.	yes
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.	neither
MONICA: Oh, honey.	sad
PHOEBE: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, &quot;ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage.&quot; Little did she know God was thinking, &quot;Ok, but that's it.&quot; Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.	neither
RACHEL: What do you mean?	neither
PHOEBE: I think it went into me. [Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe] [Central Perk]	neither
MONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.	neither
CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.	yes
RACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?	neither
ROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.	neither
CHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?	neither
RACHEL: Oh god.	neither
JOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.	neither
RACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?	neither
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.	neither
JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?	neither
PHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up! MRS. GREEN: [entering] There she is.	neither
RACHEL: Mom! MRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.	neither
RACHEL: Pretty much. MRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.	neither
RACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. MRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross.	neither
ROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.] MRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?	neither
RACHEL: Oh Mom! MRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.	neither
CHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens. MRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.	neither
RACHEL: Really? MRS GREEN: Yes.	neither
PHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.	neither
JOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?	neither
PHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales? [at Rachel and Monica's MRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.	neither
RACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. MRS GREEN: [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.	yes
RACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? MRS GREEN: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.	neither
RACHEL: For...me. MRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.	neither
RACHEL: Well, what do you mean? MRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.	neither
MONICA: [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.	yes
RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.	neither
MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.	yes
ROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?	neither
RACHEL: None.	neither
JOEY: They didn't fight a lot?	neither
RACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?	neither
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.	neither
JOEY: Hey, look who's up.	neither
RACHEL: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.	neither
MONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.	neither
RACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?	neither
CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.	neither
PHOEBE: That's him.	neither
CHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet. MR A: Phoebe?	neither
PHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. MR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.	neither
PHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit? MR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?	neither
PHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. MR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?	neither
PHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? MR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.	neither
PHOEBE: Everything? MR A: Everything.	neither
PHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. MR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.	neither
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. MR A: [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh? [Joey nods and shrugs.] MRS GREEN: Look at this.	yes
RACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago. MRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?	yes
RACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.	neither
MONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, &quot;thank you, but I don't really need your help&quot;?	neither
RACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, &quot;don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.&quot;	neither
MONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.	neither
RACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?	neither
MONICA: If you want.	neither
PHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.	neither
RACHEL: She's still with you?	neither
PHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face. MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?	neither
RACHEL: God!	neither
MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?	neither
RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex? MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.	neither
MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.	neither
RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? MRS GREEN: No.	yes
RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it? MRS GREEN: No.	neither
RACHEL: Then what? What do you want? MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.	neither
RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this? MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.	neither
RACHEL: Oh.	neither
MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!	neither
CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.	?
MONICA: Joey, speed it up!	neither
JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!	neither
PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.	neither
MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?	neither
PHOEBE: Sir! No sir!	neither
MONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!	neither
ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.	neither
MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called &quot;pigs in Ross&quot;. All right, ball the melon.	neither
CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. [knock at the door]	neither
MONICA: Hi.	neither
CAROL: How's it going?	neither
MONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]	neither
CAROL: Fine, whatever.	neither
ROSS: What's the matter?	neither
CAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.	neither
ROSS: What?	neither
MONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.	neither
ROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?	neither
CAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.	neither
ROSS: Oh my god.	neither
CAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.	neither
ROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.	neither
CAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.	neither
ROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.	neither
CAROL: You do?	neither
ROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.	neither
CAROL: Of course I do.	neither
ROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.	neither
CAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.	neither
MONICA: So we're back on?	neither
CAROL: We're back on.	neither
MONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes. [at the wedding]	neither
JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.	neither
CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. [Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]	yes
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. [Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]	neither
CAROL: Thank you.	neither
ROSS: Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]	neither
CAROL: Ross. [He lets her go]	neither
MINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.	neither
PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. [At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture taken.]	yes
MONICA: Would you look at them?	neither
ROSS: Yeah, can't help but.	neither
JOEY: [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.	neither
PHOEBE: I miss Rose.	neither
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah?	neither
PHOEBE: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.	neither
WOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?	neither
PHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice. [Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe doesn't see him.]	neither
CHANDLER: [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]	neither
RACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun? MRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.	neither
RACHEL: There's more alcohol, right? [Susan approaches Ross, who's looking lonely]	neither
SUSAN: How you doin'?	neither
ROSS: Ok.	neither
SUSAN: You did a good thing today.	neither
ROSS: Yeah.	neither
SUSAN: You wanna dance?	neither
ROSS: No, that's fine.	neither
SUSAN: Come on. I'll let you lead.	neither
ROSS: Ok. [They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]	neither
CHANDLER: [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.] [at Monica and Rachel's]	neither
MONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?	neither
ROSS: Well, Mon, I was married.	neither
PHOEBE: Yeah, me, too, technically.	neither
RACHEL: I had a wedding.	neither
MONICA: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.	neither
JOEY: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]	neither

Now take your right hand, no your other right (that was for the dyslexics), and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver.

Phoebe: Monica your remote doesn't work.	yes
Monica: Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.	can't say

Chandler: Are you aware that you're still talking?	yes
Monica: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?	yes
Ross: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.	yes
Phoebe: Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.	can't say
Ross: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.	yes

Rachel: Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?	can't say
Ross: Oh God, no.	yes
Joey: Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!	yes

[Scene: The Bing household, Mr. and Mrs. Bing and Young Chandler are eating Thanksgiving dinner as a housekeeper serves them.] Mrs. Bing: Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you.

Phoebe: All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think. (They all start thinking. Joey starts rubbing his chin, of course his chin is currently inside the turkey so he ends up rubbing the turkey.

Monica: Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!	can't say
