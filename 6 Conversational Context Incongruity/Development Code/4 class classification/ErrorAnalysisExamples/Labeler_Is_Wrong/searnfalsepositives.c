 Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old.	yes
 Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...	yes

 Chandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?	yes
 Chandler: Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or&
 Chandler: Are you aware that you're still talking?	yes
 Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. (She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)	yes
 Chandler: At least as long as I have the pants. (Pause as Frankie resumes his work.)	yes
 Chandler: At this?!	yes
 Chandler: Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.	yes

 Chandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian&

 Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, yes eight. (Monica rolls the dice.)	yes

 Chandler: Eh. I thought that was an alp.	yes
 Chandler: (entering) Hello children!	yes
 Chandler: (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)

 Chandler: Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?	yes
 Chandler: (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)	yes
 CHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. [Monica and Rachel's]	yes
 Chandler: From a bullet!	yes
 Chandler: (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!	yes

 Chandler: Hey Ross, I was wondering if&
 Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?	yes
 Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.	yes
 Chandler: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.	yes
 Chandler: Hi, I&
 Chandler: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. (They shake hands. Cut to Ross emerging from a hallway, grinning inanely. He is obviously very stoned)	yes
 Chandler: Hi, my name&
 Chandler: Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.	yes
 CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?	yes

 Chandler: I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!	yes

 Chandler: I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.	yes
 Chandler: I can't believe she can out run you man!	yes
 Chandler: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.	yes
 Chandler: I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I&
 Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.	yes
 Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.	yes
 Chandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.	yes
 Chandler: If you said, &quot;Big lima bean, bubbling up.&quot; Would she understand the difference?	yes
 Chandler: I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. [Time lapse, Monica and Chandler have changed rooms yet again.]	yes

 Chandler: I just came over to drop off&
 Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.	yes
 Chandler: I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the &quot;new thing you do that day!&quot; (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!	yes
 Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!	yes
 Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. (Rachel enters.)	yes
 Chandler: I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.	yes
 Chandler: I'm over here big guy.	yes
 Chandler: I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.	yes
 Chandler: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. [Time lapse. Melanie, Joey's girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel. Ross is gone.]	yes
 CHANDLER: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without saying anything] That's actually good.	yes
 Chandler: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.	yes
 Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.	yes
 Chandler: It's a kitchen slash bathroom.	yes
 Chandler: It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family. (And with that, we start a series of flashbacks to Thanksgiving's of years gone by.) Thanksgiving 1978	yes
 Chandler: It's exactly like it sounds. Thanksgiving 1992	yes
 Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.	yes
 Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.	yes
 Chandler: It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!	yes
 Chandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army... (A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by italics.)	yes
 Chandler: I wish I had smoked for my career&
 Chandler: Joey's a sex addict.	yes
 Chandler: Joey... Switzerland? (The waitress brings their coffee.)	yes
 CHANDLER: Joey was in a porno movie.	yes
 Chandler: Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you&
 Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?	yes
 Chandler: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.	yes
 Chandler: Let's go quicker.	yes
 CHANDLER: Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice. [Rachel and Ross go out in the hall]	yes
 Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)	yes
 Chandler: Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.	yes
 CHANDLER: Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?	yes
 Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'	yes
 Chandler: (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.	yes
 Chandler: (looking down) What gave me away?	yes
 Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. &nbsp; You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. &nbsp; Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!&nbsp; I don't think that was my point!	yes
 Chandler: (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!	yes
 Chandler: Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit. (Joey gestures to show that he wouldn't dare...)	yes
 Chandler: Man, she is really gullible. (Monica motions that it went right over Rachel's head.)	yes
 Chandler: Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.	yes
 Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman. (Enter Joey)	yes
 Chandler: Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.	yes
 Chandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.	yes
 CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat. (Chandler has a basketball which he is moving closer to, then away from, Monica)	yes
 Chandler: Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat. Commercial Break	yes
 Chandler: More so than anything else.	yes
 Chandler: Much sense?!	yes
 CHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.	yes
 Chandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.	yes
 Chandler: No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!	yes
 Chandler: No, I&
 Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.	yes
 Chandler: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough. Mrs. Bing: Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)	yes
 Chandler: No, just the months you actually want to live here.	yes
 Chandler: No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea! (Joey starts to leave to embark on his genius moneymaking scheme, but is freaked out slightly when as he goes to open the door, there's a mysterious knock. He calms himself down and opens the door to reveal Phoebe.)	yes
 Chandler: No, no no no. You&
 Chandler: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.	yes
 Chandler: No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)	yes
 Chandler: Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!	yes
 Chandler: (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open. [Monica enters]	yes
 Chandler: No thanks, Josephine.	yes
 Chandler: No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?	yes
 Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!	yes
 Chandler: Nothing! I said, I said &quot;You're so great&quot; and then I just, I just stopped talking!	yes
 Chandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.	yes
 Chandler: (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)	yes
 Chandler: (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!	yes
 Chandler: Now imagine you live at the supermarket.	yes
 Chandler: Now, is that never talking about it again?!	yes
 Chandler: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum. (Ross exits.)	yes
 Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving. [Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]	yes
 CHANDLER: Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.	yes
 Chandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say &quot;No thanks, I'm married.&quot;	yes
 CHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. (At Somplace Nice)	yes
 Chandler: Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!	yes
 Chandler: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.	yes
 Chandler: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...	yes
 Chandler: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.	yes
 Chandler: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I&
 Chandler: Oh, great. This is just... (Chandler sees that there is a gorgeous model inside the vestibule with him. He makes a gesture of quiet exuberance.) Opening Credits	yes
 Chandler: Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.	yes
 Chandler: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?	yes
 Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...	yes
 Chandler: Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)	yes
 Chandler: Oh, I don't know, a million?	yes
 Chandler: Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?	yes
 Chandler: Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever&
 Chandler: Oh, I'm going on the lamb.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?	yes
 Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.	yes
 Chandler: Oh Joey&
 Chandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush. (Janice enters.)	yes
 Chandler: Oh my God!	yes
 Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this. (Phone rings; Monica gets it)	yes
 Chandler: Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, &quot;Quack, quack!&quot; I&
 Chandler: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY. (Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season. Read about it here.)	yes
 Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...	yes
 Chandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?	yes
 Chandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy. (Chandler strides proudly across the vestibule and Jill stares at him.)	yes
 CHANDLER: Oh sweet Moses.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.	yes
 Chandler: Oh that is over!	yes
 CHANDLER: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, that was my work laugh.	yes
 Chandler: Oh the humanity.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, the tears are real.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!	yes
 Chandler: Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?	yes
 Chandler: Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!	yes
 Chandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'	yes
 CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]	yes
 Chandler: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.	yes
 Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)	yes
 Chandler: Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)	yes
 Chandler: Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef. Fat Monica: Okay! (He gets up and walks away as Rachel come running over all excited.) Big Nosed Rachel: Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight! Fat Monica: Oh that's so great! Big Nosed Rachel: I know! Fat Monica: Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything. Big Nosed Rachel: Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know. Fat Monica: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it! Big Nosed Rachel: I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song! [Cut to the kitchen, Ross and Chandler are doing the dishes.]	yes
 Chandler: Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!	yes
 CHANDLER: Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.	yes
 CHANDLER: Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.	yes
 Chandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.	yes
 Chandler: Oh yes, somebody just said, &quot;Can you hear anything?&quot; (Joey is bent over at the waist and is looking for something under Monica's bed.)	yes
 Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary? (The guys all duck under the table.)	yes
 Chandler: Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, &quot;Who's the best of that?&quot; They'd have to go to you.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, how long is this going to go on.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I&
 Chandler: Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?	yes
 Chandler: Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, let&
 Chandler: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.	yes
 Chandler: Okay, so Richard, Richard!	yes
 Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit!	yes

 CHANDLER: OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.	yes
 Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go. (They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)	yes
 CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.	yes
 CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. (At Monica and Rachel's)	yes
 Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)	yes
 Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.	yes
 Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.	yes
 Chandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.	yes
 Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.	yes
 Chandler: Ow!	yes
 Chandler: (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!	yes
 Chandler: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?	yes
 Chandler: (Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, that&
 Chandler: (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.	yes
 Chandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if you&
 Chandler: Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine. (Another man, an older man, enters, looking around and bumps into Chandler.)	yes
 Chandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!	yes
 Chandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)	yes
 Chandler: (reading the ad) &quot;Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.&quot; Nice!	yes
 Chandler: Really? Worse than, &quot;More turkey Mr. Chandler?&quot;	yes
 Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?	yes
 Chandler: Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you&
 Chandler: (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.	yes
 Chandler: (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.	yes
 Chandler: Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?	yes
 Chandler: See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!	yes
 Chandler: She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.	yes
 Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?	yes
 Chandler: (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)	yes
 Chandler: Shocking! Since you still have the keys.	yes
 CHANDLER: [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.	yes
 Chandler: So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?	yes
 Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? (An awkward silence ensues.)	yes
 CHANDLER: So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog. 	yes
 Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple? Dr. Franzblau: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.	yes
 Chandler: So, rocks. (He picks up a smaller box and carries it to the moving van as Joey returns.)	yes
 Chandler: Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.	yes
 CHANDLER: Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.	yes
 Chandler: So, we&

 Chandler: Thank you, buddy.	yes
 Chandler: Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.	yes
 Chandler: That&
 Chandler: That is amazing.	yes
 Chandler: That is true.	yes
 Chandler: That. Opening Credits	yes
 Chandler: That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn&
 Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.	yes
 Chandler: That's not specific to girls.	yes
 Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!! Jay Leno: (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going? Mrs. Bing: (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...	yes
 Chandler: That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!	yes
 Chandler: That was amazing.	yes
 Chandler: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.	yes
 Chandler: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...	yes
 Chandler: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.	yes
 Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.	yes
 Chandler: There you are.	yes
 Chandler: They&
 Chandler: They're still just friends, right?	yes
 CHANDLER: This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.	yes
 Chandler: This is unbelievable. It&
 Chandler: This took you all day?!	yes
 Chandler: (to Joey) You are really frightening me. (Carol suddenly screams in pain and grabs Chandler by the shirt.)	yes
 Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey!	yes
 Chandler: (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.	yes
 Chandler: Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.	yes
 Chandler: (To Rachel) He has a gun! Closing Credits	yes
 Chandler: (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.	yes
 Chandler: (to Ross) &quot;Big guy?&quot;	yes
 Chandler: (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.	yes
 Chandler: Tyrannosaurus! (They all cross they're arms like the Power Rangers do)	yes
 Chandler: Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.	yes
 CHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed. MR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.	yes
 Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?	yes
 Chandler: Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.	yes
 Chandler: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?	yes
 Chandler: Was the setting of Phoebe&
 Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.	yes
 CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.	yes
 Chandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.	yes
 Chandler: Well, I-I still think you&
 CHANDLER: Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.	yes
 Chandler: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)	yes
 CHANDLER: Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.	yes
 CHANDLER: Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?	yes
 Chandler: Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we&
 Chandler: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?	yes
 Chandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one&
 Chandler: Well, I think it's very brave what you said. (Monica pats Joey on the shoulder.)	yes
 Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.	yes
 CHANDLER: Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track. OPENING TITLES	yes
 Chandler: Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?	yes
 Chandler: Well it's not flexed right now!	yes
 Chandler: Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.	yes
 Chandler: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.	yes
 Chandler: Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised. (Ross and Julie exit)	yes
 Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?	yes
 Chandler: Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.	yes
 Chandler: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.	yes
 Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.	yes
 CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. [Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]	yes
 CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.	yes
 Chandler: Well, only if you order stuff.	yes
 Chandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that? (They all groan and hit him..) End	yes
 Chandler: We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.	yes
 Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey...	yes
 Chandler: Well that would help the pride thing.	yes
 CHANDLER: Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.	yes
 Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?	yes
 Chandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.	yes
 Chandler: Well, what did the police say?	yes
 Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!	yes
 Chandler: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.	yes
 Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear&
 Chandler: We're flipping Monica's mattress.	yes
 Chandler: Were you're parents happy, or something?	yes
 Chandler: We should always always break up together.	yes
 Chandler: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.	yes
 Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.	yes
 Chandler: What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!	yes
 CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? (on the sidewalk outside Central Perk)	yes
 CHANDLER: What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.	yes
 CHANDLER: Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year. [Ross enters with several bags from shopping.]	yes
 Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?	yes
 Chandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?	yes
 CHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.	yes
 Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I don&
 Chandler: Who jumps at loud noises!	yes
 Chandler: Why am I looking?	yes
 CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?	yes
 CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.	yes
 CHANDLER: Work on your music? [Ross is sitting on the stairs with a laptop keyboard playing 'Axel-F']	yes
 CHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.	yes
 CHANDLER: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?	yes
 CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously. JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.	yes
 Chandler: Wow, this is serious. I&
 Chandler: Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo. (Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)	yes
 Chandler: Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, it&
 Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.	yes
 CHANDLER: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.	yes
 CHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah umm, they're called wallets.

 Chandler: Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, you almost overreacted to something. Phoebe and Gary: (entering) Hey!	yes
 Chandler: Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.	yes
 Chandler: Yes, but for the last time.	yes
 Chandler: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I&

 Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?	yes
 Chandler: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.	yes

 CHAN: Good luck. [Chandler and Joey leave quickly.]	yes
 CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.	yes
 CHAN: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.	yes
 CHAN: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.	yes
 CHAN: Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.	yes
 CHAN: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.	yes
 CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.	yes
 Cop: (following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. (Phoebe's stunned) And where did you find my badge?	yes

 Danny: Bread. Aren't you a chef? (Rachel returns.)	yes
 Danny: Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.	yes

 Doug: (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?	yes

 Joey: Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.	yes
 Joey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you? Mrs. Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else.

 Joey: No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!	yes

 Joey: No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?	yes

 Joey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?! Mrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.	yes
 Joey: So you uh, still wondering?	yes

 Joey: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they&

 Joey: Well, back to square one.	yes
 Joey: Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her roommate!	yes

Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... [Time Lapse.] Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.

 Monica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.	yes
 Monica: Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.	yes
 Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., &quot;I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.&quot; was what?&nbsp; A wrong number?	yes
 Monica: Oh, So you can move them!	yes

 Monica: (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her! (Chandler starts to follow her into the kitchen.)	yes
 Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?	yes
 Monica: Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.	yes
 MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.	yes
 Monica: &quot;Hi I&

 Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!	yes
 Monica: Really!	yes
 Monica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?	yes
 Monica: Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married. (Danny enters.)	yes
 MONICA: Ross, that is gorgeous!	yes
 Monica: (sarcastic) Come on eight.	yes
 Monica: See if he has ice.	yes
 Monica: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.	yes
 Monica: She is unbelievable, our mother is...	yes
 Monica: She will be after tonight.	yes
 Monica: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.	yes
 Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?	yes
 Monica: Sure, every time, you're such a princess...	yes
 Monica: Thank you. My hair is very amused.	yes
 Monica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.	yes
 MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)	yes
 Monica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.	yes
 MONICA: That is wild.	yes
 Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.	yes

 Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! [Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by playing the national anthem.]	yes
 Monica: Well, at least you scared someone.	yes
 Monica: Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.	yes
 Monica: Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it. (The phone rings.)	yes
 Monica: Well, I think I shouldn&
 Monica: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.	yes
 Monica: Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.	yes
 Monica: Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.	yes
 Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I&
 Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!	yes
 Monica: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.	yes
 Monica: What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! (Rachel slowly leaves the apartment.)	yes
 Monica: What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!	yes
 Monica: What's that supposed to mean? Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.	yes
 Monica: What?! What is it? The Doctor: You brought a carrot.	yes
 Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?	yes
 Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.	yes
 Monica: Who? Two divorces and Joey?!	yes
 Monica: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?	yes
 MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.	yes
 Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.	yes
 MONICA: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.	yes
 Monica: Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?	yes
 Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!	yes

 Monica: Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.	yes
 Monica: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that&

 Monica: Yeah, well I don&
 Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-&quot;I-win&quot;-guy. (imitating) &quot;I win! I win!&quot; I went out with the guy for two months&

 Monica: You&
 Monica: You become friends after?	yes
 Monica: You can, I know you can!	yes
 Monica: You could do that!	yes
 Monica: You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)	yes
 Monica: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. (Chandler laughs.)	yes
 Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?	yes
 MONICA: You've got to get back out there, it's your party. DR. BURKE: But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.	yes

 Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.	yes
 Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?	yes
 Phoebe: All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, &quot;Who hear likes Ross,&quot; and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!

 PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?	yes
 Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!	yes
 Phoebe: A real man wouldn&
 Phoebe: Are you just repeating what I'm saying? The Teacher: All right, let's move on.	yes

 Phoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play!	yes
 Phoebe: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.	yes
 Phoebe: Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!	yes
 Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!	yes
 Phoebe: Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.	yes

 Phoebe: Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!	yes
 Phoebe: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!	yes

 PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.	yes
 Phoebe: I can't believe you did that! Opening Credits	yes
 Phoebe: I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.	yes
 Phoebe: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.	yes
 Phoebe: I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?	yes

 Phoebe: I saw it.	yes
 Phoebe: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.	yes
 Phoebe: It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?	yes
 Phoebe: It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!	yes
 Phoebe: I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!	yes
 Phoebe: Just get your nails done?	yes

 Phoebe: No-no, it&
 Phoebe: No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)	yes

 Phoebe: No, we can go together! Just don&
 Phoebe: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.	yes
 Phoebe: Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.	yes
 Phoebe: Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.	yes
 Phoebe: Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.	yes

 Phoebe: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.	yes
 Phoebe: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!	yes
 Phoebe: You can't put your cigarette out on a tree! The Smoking Woman: Yeah I can, it worked real well.	yes
 Phoebe: You didn't read this one either?!	yes
 Phoebe: You got me.	yes
 Phoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.	yes
 Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.	yes
 Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. (Pause)	yes
 PHOE: No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.	yes
 PHOE: Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.	yes
 PHOE: That is funny.	yes
 PHOE: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.	yes
 PRODUCER: Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.	yes
 RACH: [coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.	yes
 Rachel: All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)	yes
 RACHEL: Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.	yes
 Rachel: And a crappy New Year.	yes
 Rachel: And Chandler, you&
 Rachel: And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) The Guys: (reluctantly) Yeah.	yes
 Rachel: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.	yes
 Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!	yes
 Rachel: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?	yes
 Rachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.	yes
 Rachel: And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick? (Chandler silently pleads with Joey to cover for them.)	yes
 Rachel: Any chance you think the couch looks good there?	yes
 Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.	yes
 Rachel: Are you okay? You&
 Rachel: Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?	yes
 Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.&nbsp; And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)	yes
 Rachel: Because a car backfired?	yes
 Rachel: Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch. Closing Credits	yes
 Rachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.	yes
 Rachel: Come on Phoebe! Don&
 Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.	yes
 Rachel: (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you&
 Rachel: (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.	yes
 Rachel: (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.	yes
 Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.	yes
 Rachel: God. I feel violated.	yes
 Rachel: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally&
 Rachel: (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right? (Ross is stunned.) Ending Credits	yes
 Rachel: Good luck, honey!	yes
 Rachel: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.	yes
 Rachel: Great! Dr. Miller: And I'll fit you for a glass eye.	yes
 Rachel: Great! Thanks!	yes
 Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?	yes
 Rachel: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!	yes
 Rachel: Hey, hubby!	yes
 Rachel: Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?	yes
 Rachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.	yes
 Rachel: Hi! Wow! You look, you look&
 Rachel: Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.	yes
 RACHEL: Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?	yes
 RACHEL: How have you never been on Oprah?	yes
 RACHEL: Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.	yes
 Rachel: I&
 Rachel: I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause &quot;Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!&quot;	yes
 Rachel: I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!	yes
 Rachel: I could not have done this without you. (Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of silence follows.)	yes
 Rachel: I didn&
 Rachel: I don't think he's the one who needs help. (They both sit down.)	yes
 Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.	yes
 Rachel: I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn&
 Rachel: I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.	yes
 Rachel: I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!	yes
 Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.	yes
 Rachel: Joey, how do you make that dirty?	yes
 Rachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?	yes
 Rachel: (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!	yes
 Rachel: (leaving to serve others) Good for me! (The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters.&nbsp; She sits down without saying hi.)	yes
 Rachel: Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!	yes
 RACHEL: Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.	yes
 Rachel: (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. Pizza Guy: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!	yes
 Rachel: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)	yes
 Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer. Mrs. Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.	yes
 Rachel: Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.	yes
 Rachel: No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.	yes
 Rachel: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.	yes
 Rachel: No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)	yes
 Rachel: No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!	yes
 Rachel: No, no don&
 Rachel: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.	yes
 Rachel: No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.	yes
 Rachel: Not unless different means the same.	yes
 RACHEL: Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. [goes in the bathroom]	yes
 Rachel: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door) [Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachel's.]	yes
 Rachel: Oh, all right. But y&
 RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?	yes
 Rachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.	yes
 Rachel: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!	yes
 Rachel: Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!	yes
 Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.	yes
 Rachel: Oh, great!	yes
 Rachel: Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)	yes
 Rachel: Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?	yes
 RACHEL: Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it. [Phoebe enters all dressed up]	yes
 Rachel: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!	yes
 Rachel: Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?	yes
 Rachel: Ohh, okay, I&
 Rachel: Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!	yes
 Rachel: Ohh, thank God! Finally!	yes
 Rachel: Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)	yes
 Rachel: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. (The same woman walks over and takes Rachel's laundry cart.)	yes
 Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?	yes
 RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? MRS GREEN: No.	yes
 Rachel: Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.	yes
 Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...	yes
 Rachel: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?	yes
 Rachel: Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.	yes
 Rachel: Oh, okay, not so weird. [Cut to another part of the room, Ross is going to talk to Joey.]	yes
 RACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?	yes
 Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)	yes
 Rachel: Oh really? Like what Monica?	yes
 Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?	yes
 Rachel: Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.	yes
 Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.	yes
 Rachel: Oh yeah, good start Mon.	yes
 Rachel: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.	yes
 Rachel: Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!	yes
 Rachel: Okay guys, way to wish me luck!	yes
 Rachel: Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.	yes
 Rachel: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.	yes
 Rachel: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of &quot;us?&quot; (Ross storms off embarrassed.)	yes
 Rachel: Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.	yes
 Rachel: Okay that is the one we already have!	yes
 Rachel: Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!	yes
 Rachel: Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. (She leaves them to wrestle.)	yes
 Rachel: Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.	yes
 Rachel: (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now. End	yes
 Rachel: (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.	yes
 Rachel: Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.	yes
 Rachel: (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him) (Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)	yes
 Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!	yes
 Rachel: &quot;I&
 Rachel: &quot;Oh my God, I can&
 Rachel: Really? Fireman No. 2: Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.	yes
 Rachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.	yes
 RACHEL: Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.	yes
 Rachel: Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.	yes
 Rachel: Ross, I am a human doodle!!	yes
 Rachel: Ross! Janice?!	yes
 Rachel: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You&
 Rachel: Ross! The Salesman: Well you, her, I mean, she's very&
 RACHEL: (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.	yes
 Rachel: She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!	yes
 Rachel: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.) Woman No. 1: (looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!	yes
 Rachel: So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. (He kisses her.)	yes
 Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?	yes
 Rachel: (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don&
 Rachel: So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?	yes
 Rachel: (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just&
 Rachel: Storming out!	yes
 Rachel: (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.	yes
 Rachel: Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.	yes
 Rachel: Thanks Chandler.	yes
 Rachel: That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?	yes
 Rachel: That-that is your make out buddy. Don&
 Rachel: Then, you will definitely get him back!	yes
 Rachel: There were times when it wasn't even me. (Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other then recoil in horror.)	yes
 RACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago. MRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?	yes
 Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!	yes
 Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?	yes
 Rachel: (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?	yes
 RACHEL: [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.	yes
 Rachel: (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you&
 Rachel: Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?! (Rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.)	yes
 Rachel: Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.	yes
 Rachel: Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.	yes
 Rachel: Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day&

 Rachel: (under her breath) Sucker!	yes
 Rachel: We didn't change..	yes
 Rachel: Well and clearly not a minute sooner.	yes
 Rachel: Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!	yes
 Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.	yes
 Rachel: Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.	yes
 Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!	yes
 Rachel: Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.	yes
 Rachel: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.	yes
 RACHEL: Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.	yes
 Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?	yes
 Rachel: Well, sure, but they might think it&
 Rachel: Well sure, if you say you&
 Rachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.	yes
 Rachel: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.	yes
 Rachel: Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs after him.)	yes
 Rachel: Well, who wouldn&
 Rachel: Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.	yes
 Rachel: Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.	yes
 Rachel: Well, you would know.	yes
 RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program? (Monica's pager goes off)	yes
 Rachel: What?	yes
 Rachel: Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)	yes
 Rachel: Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!	yes
 RACHEL: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.	yes
 Rachel: Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.	yes
 Rachel: Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!	yes
 Rachel: Wow.	yes
 Rachel: Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risquï¿½ pose, at least for primetime TV.)	yes
 Rachel: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.	yes
 Rachel: Wow, you guys, this is big.	yes
 Rachel: Yay!	yes
 Rachel: Yeah and you stretch &
 Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!	yes
 Rachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.	yes
 Rachel: Yeah, I&
 Rachel: Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just&
 Rachel: Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.	yes
 Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)	yes
 Rachel: Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye. Dr. Miller: Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.	yes
 Rachel: Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.	yes
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. (We see through the big window from the outside and see that Monica and Rachel have pictures of their faces pasted onto cardboard cutouts of Pamela Anderson and Yasmine Bleeth wearing their Baywatch swimsuits.)	yes
 Rachel: Yeah, right.&nbsp; Sure!	yes
 Rachel: Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There&
 RACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. MRS GREEN: [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.	yes
 RACHEL: Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?	yes
 Rachel: Yeah, yeah I think I&
 Rachel: Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, &quot;Nice try.&quot; (He walks off.)	yes
 Rachel: Yes, but still. They're people&
 Rachel: Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks) The Flight Attendant: (To Ross) Hope you had a nice flight.	yes
 Rachel: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.	yes
 Rachel: Y'know who I always liked? Mork. (Dr. Harad drops what he's doing and stares at her.)	yes
 Rachel: You brought a carrot?! Mrs. Geller: Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.	yes
 Rachel: You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.	yes
 RACH: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!	yes
 RACH: OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?	yes
 RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.	yes
 RACH: Steve... sleeve!	yes
 RACH: That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking]	yes
 RACH: [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.	yes
 RACH: Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . . [Rachel looks at Ross as though she remembers something, but can't place what it is.]	yes
 RACH: Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, &quot;Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.&quot;	yes
 RADIO: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.	yes
 Receptionist: (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.	yes
 RICHARD: Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...	yes
 Roger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.	yes
 Roger: I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.	yes
 Roger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love. (He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it)	yes
 Roger: That's pretty much it.	yes
 Roger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.	yes
 Ross: &
 Ross: Ah, the lesser-known &quot;I don't have a dream&quot; speech. (Monica enters, excited.)	yes
 Ross: ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!	yes
 Ross: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...	yes
 Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.	yes
 Ross: And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.	yes
 Ross: And thank you, for that.	yes
 ROSS: And that wasn't fun for you?	yes
 Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier? Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?	yes
 ROSS: Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?	yes
 Ross: (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello? [Cut to the living room where Monica is helping pack a box.]	yes
 Ross: A wandering?	yes
 Ross: Awww, man! Really?	yes
 Ross: Baking it didn't help, huh?	yes
 ROSS: Better not be doin' these in order.	yes
 Ross: Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!	yes
 Ross: (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...	yes
 Ross: C'mon! C'mon!	yes
 Ross: Come on, you made coffee! &nbsp; You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)	yes
 Ross: Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)	yes
 ROSS: Did you see me write one down?	yes
 Ross: (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!	yes
 Ross: Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.	yes
 Ross: Do they wait for me to do this? (Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel's apartment)	yes
 Ross: Do you know the word crapweasel?	yes
 Ross: Dude, you are sick.	yes

 ROSS: Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.	yes
 Ross: Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.	yes
 ROSS: [holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?	yes
 Ross: How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!	yes
 Ross: How do you know? You don't have a watch.	yes

 Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.	yes
 Ross: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.	yes
 Ross: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.	yes
 Ross: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.	yes
 Ross: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!	yes

 Ross: It's morphin time!	yes

 Ross: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.	yes
 Ross: No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?	yes
 ROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!	yes

 Ross: Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you&
 Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.	yes

 ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.	yes
 Ross: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big drink!	yes
 ROSS: Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.	yes
 Ross: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...	yes

 Ross: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the store.) The Salesman: Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a wall.)	yes
 ROSS: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.	yes
 ROSS: Oh you do, do you?	yes

 Ross: (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.	yes
 Ross: Some days it's all I can think about.	yes
 Ross: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.	yes
 Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?	yes
