 Joey: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.	no

 Ross: I know.	no

 Melanie: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'	no

 Joey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.	no

 Monica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?	no

 Joey: Then you do. Heh, heh.	no

 Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?	no

 Chandler: (quickly) H-He's in China!	no

 Joey: The country.	no

 Monica: No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.	no

 Monica: From here to the airport?	no

 Chandler: Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!	no

 Rachel: I-I-I don't know.	no

 Chandler: Well then maybe you shouldn't go.	no

 Joey: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.	no

 Monica: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.	no

 Rachel: I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.	no

 Phoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help? (Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)	no

 Rachel: No, I know, but I&
 Rachel: OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important. Flight Attendant: Alright. What's the message?	no

 Melanie: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!	no

 Joey: Heh, heh. It was nothin'.	no

 Melanie: (surprised) M-Me again?	no

 Joey: Sure! Why not?	no

 Melanie: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.	no

 Joey: How do you mean?	no

 Rachel: I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. Monica and Phoebe: Sure.	no

 Rachel: I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.	no

 Monica: Another good point.	no

 Phoebe: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.	no

 Rachel: (confused) Huh?	no

 Monica: Why isn't it working out?	no

 Rachel: I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.	no

 Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?	no

 Rachel: No!	no

 Monica: Does he not make enough money?	no

 Rachel: No! There is.. there is noone else!	no

 Chandler: Hey, big...	no

 Joey: Shhhh!	no

 Chandler: (quietly) ...spender.	no

 Joey: She's still asleep.	no

 Joey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?	no

 Chandler: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.	no

 Joey: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!	no

 Joey: I know! Neither did I!	no

 Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?	no

 Rachel: Yeah.	no

 Monica: Oh, from who?	no

 Rachel: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.	no

 Rachel: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this&

 Rachel: Who is it?	no

 Rachel: C'mon up.	no

 Joey: Seven hundred bucks!	no

 Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?	no

 Joey: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.	no

 Rachel: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.	no

 Ross: Can't do it, can you?	no

 Rachel: So I'm thinking about you. So what?	no

 Ross: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?	no

 Carl: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!	no

 Ross: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.	no

 Rachel: Ross, it's too hard.	no

 Rachel: Ross, you're like my best friend.	no

 Ross: I know.	no

 Rachel: If we broke up, and I lost you...	no

 Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?	no

 Rachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?	no

 Ross: (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?	no

 Rachel: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.	no

 Ross: Well, start looking. (They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)	no

 Rachel: Wow.	no

 Carl: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!	no

 Rachel: Right! You're right!	no

 Carl: Heh... y'know?	no

 Rachel: You know what?	no

 Carl: What?	no

 Carl: But...	no

 Ross: Oh, hey, hey, I got that. (Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)	no

 Ross: (seeing her) Rach!	no

 Ross: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?	no

 Rachel: What?	no

 Ross: You're bleeding.	no

 Rachel: I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)	no

 Ross: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.	no

 Rachel: These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly, thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.	no

 Julie: (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.	no

 Rachel: Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.	no

 Julie: Oh my god.	no

 Ross:&nbsp; The screaming guy?	no

 Ross: You gotta hear this story.	no

 Ross: 200 at least.	no

 Julie:&nbsp; ...and this guy...	no

 Julie: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.	no

 Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.	no

 Monica: (to Julie) It's an expression.	no

 Ross: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.	no

 Julie: And then we've gotta get some sleep.	no

 Ross: I didn't order lemonade.	no

 Ross: But...	no

 Rachel: Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So uh, what did you find out?	no

 Chandler: He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!&nbsp; Without any outside help whatsoever.	no

 Rachel: How is that the silver lining?	no

 Chandler: You have to really wanna see it.	no

 Ross: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. [Cut to Phoebe and Monica in the kitchen.]	no

 Monica: Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?	no

 Monica: No, although now that's what I'm thinking.	no

 Phoebe: All right, so what were you thinking?	no

 Monica: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?	no

 Phoebe: Ohh! No.	no

 Monica: Why not?	no

 Monica: No you're not.	no

 Joey: (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)	no

 Rachel: (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.	no

 Monica: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.	no

 Rachel: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)	no

 Monica: Rachel, how did this happen?	no

 Rachel: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.	no

 Phoebe: Where?	no

 Rachel: At his apartment. Is this juice?	no

 Phoebe: All right. Ok, but, but!&nbsp; You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.	no

 Monica: I promise.	no

 Phoebe: All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.	no

 Phoebe: All right, that's it, I quit.	no

 Monica: What? I didn't say anything.	no

 Phoebe: Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.	no

 Chandler: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...	no

 Ross: What?	no

 Chandler: Cupping.	no

 Joey: That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?	no

 Rachel: No. No-no-no-no.	no

 Rachel: Really?	no

 Rachel: No, I think that was the whole all.	no

 Carol: Why'd you freak out?	no

 Ross: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.	no

 Carol: My breast milk is gross?	no

 Ross: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.	no

 RACHEL: Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.	no

 CHANDLER: Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.	no

 PHOEBE: No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.	no

 RACHEL: Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.	no

 PHOEBE: No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.	no

 PHOEBE: [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.	no

 PHOEBE: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]	no

 PHOEBE: OK, is this really my father?	no

 GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: Look, I. . .	no

 PHOEBE: Oh God.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: Honey.	no

 PHOEBE: [realizes] Oh.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a picture out] This is the real him.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: Hey.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?	no

 PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.	no

 PHOEBE: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.	no

 GRANDMOTHER: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.	no

 PHOEBE: Whattaya mean?	no

 PHOEBE: Wow. Thank you.	no

 JOEY: Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.	no

 CHANDLER: Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. [Phoebe drives up in the cab]	no

 JOEY: Hey, here she comes.	no

 RACHEL: Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.	no

 MONICA: Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?	no

 PHOEBE: No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .	no

 JOEY: Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.	no

 CHANDLER: Well, so why not go knock?	no

 PHOEBE: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.	no

 JOEY: Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.	no

 PHOEBE: Yeah?	no

 JOEY: Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.	no

 PHOEBE: You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.	no

 JOEY: Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?	no

 PHOEBE: Oh, I couldn't go in.	no

 MONICA: Honey, I'm sorry.	no

 ROSS: Are you OK?	no

 PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.	no

 JOEY: Rach, these are for you.	no

 RACHEL: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.	no

 JOEY: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.	no

 CHANDLER: OK, Phoebs, your turn.	no

 JOEY: Uh-huh.	no

 PHOEBE: You guuuyys.	no

 JOEY: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.	no

 JOEY: I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.	no

 PHOE: OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...	no

 ROSS: I don't want to.	no

 RACH: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.	no

 ROSS: Yeah.	no

 ROSS: Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.	no

 JOEY: When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff. [Ross enters, depressed.]	no

 ROSS: [sullenly] Hiiiiii.	no

 PHOE: Are... are you OK?	no

 JOEY: No, I'm alright man. Really.	no

 FBOB: No, I'm picking you up.	no

 FBOB: See ya. [exits]	no

 ALL: Bye! See you later!	no

 PHOE: Fun Bobby is so great.	no

 MNCA: Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.	no

 PHOE: Half full of looooovvvvve.	no

 MNCA: And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.	no

 PHOE: Cabin of loooooovvvvve.	no

 MNCA: Really? I only had two glasses.	no

 JOEY: I just had a glass.	no

 MNCA: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?	no

 RACH: Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.	no

 RACH: Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.	no

 MNCA: Bobby.	no

 FBOB: Yeah, OK.	no

 MNCA: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.	no

 MNCA: So, what are you saying now?	no

 FBOB: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. [they hug]	no

 PHOE: [sad] Ooohh, why? [Chandler and Joey enter.]	no

 JOEY: Hey.	no

 MNCA: Hey.	no

 PHOE: Hey.	no

 PHOE: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?	no

 PHOE: Oh, no.	no

 PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.	no

 RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.	no

 MNCA: [gasps] You have other friends?	no

 RACH: Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.	no

 MNCA: What?	no

 MNCA: What are you talking about?	no

 RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.	no

 PHOE: But you guys came so close.	no

 RACH: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.	no

 ESTL: Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? [a knock on the door] Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later. [Joey enters.]	no

 ESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?	no

 JOEY: No.	no

 ESTL: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]	no

 JOEY: OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...	no

 RACH: What's the matter?	no

 MNCA: It's Fun Bobby.	no

 RACH: What, isn't he sober?	no

 MNCA: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.	no

 RACH: Ohhh, OK. [Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]	no

 MNCA: Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]	no

 FBOB: Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?	no

 MNCA: Oh God, yes!	no

 FBOB: There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.	no

 FBOB: Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]	no

 MNCA: Oh.... my... God.	no

 PHOE: It's not that bad.	no

 MNCA: Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?	no

 PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.	no

 RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.	no

 PHOE: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free. [Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]	no

 RUSS: Hi.	no

 RACH: Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?	no

 RUSS: OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people. [Phoebe walks up to Rachel, cleaning tables.]	no

 PHOE: Rachel? Um, hi.	no

 RACH: Hi.	no

 PHOE: OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?	no

 RACH: Uhh.... waitressing?	no

 RACH: [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?	no

 PHOE: [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh. [Phoebe turns back around but Rachel is gone. Ross enters.]	no

 PHOE: Oh, my, oh!	no

 ROSS: What? What's wrong?	no

 PHOE: I, OK....	no

 MNCA: She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.	no

 ROSS: Alright.	no

 RUSS: Hi.	no

 ROSS: Hi.	no

 RUSS: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?	no

 ROSS: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?	no

 RUSS: Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.	no

 ROSS: A date.	no

 RUSS: Yeah, I'm her date.	no

 ROSS: I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.	no

 RACH: Oh.	no

 ROSS: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.	no

 RACH: Well, we're not seeing each other, so....	no

 ROSS: Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...	no

 RACH: Well, yeah, this is the deal.	no

 ROSS: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.	no

 RACH: Um, Russ, you ready?	no

 RUSS: Yeah.	no

 RACH: Bye.	no

 MNCA: Bye.	no

 PHOE: Bye. [Russ and Rachel leave together.]	no

 ROSS: [upset] She's dating. She's dating.	no

 ROSS: What do you mean?	no

 MNCA: Do you not see it?	no

 JOEY: Hey.	no

 JOEY: Sorry.	no

 JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.	no

 FBOB: If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.	no

 MNCA: No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.	no

 MNCA: [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.	no

 RUSS: Dysprosium.	no

 ROSS: [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.	no

 PHOE: You don't see it? You actually don't see it?	no

 RACH: What?	no

 PHOE: OK honey, you're dating Ross.	no

 RACH: No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.	no

 PHOE: Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!	no

 RACH: Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing. [They look over at Russ and Ross.]	no

 ROSS: [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.	no

 RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.	no

 RUSS: I know what your problem is.	no

 RUSS: Um-hum, you're jealous.	no

 ROSS: Of... of what?	no

 RUSS: You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.	no

 RUSS: Hey, you listen.	no

 ROSS: No, no, let me finish.	no

 RUSS: No, let me finish.	no

 ROSS: No, you let me fini... [Rachel walks up behind them.]	no

 ROSS: Hi.	no

 RUSS: Hi.	no

 RACH: Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?	no

 RACH: I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?	no

 RACH: Why would I have to sleep with you?	no

 MNCA: Morning.	no

 ROSS: Ooooohhhh. [Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]	no

 PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?	no

 MNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing. [Three slow knocks on the door.]	no

 MNCA: Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.	no

 FBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?	no

 MNCA: Sure. [They both step out into the hall.]	no

 FBOB: This is really hard for me to say.	no

 FBOB: Oh, no, no, it's about you.	no

 MNCA: What about me?	no

 MNCA: What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.	no

 MNCA: Oh... shoot.	no

 FBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.	no

 MNCA: OK. [They hug and kiss.]	no

 MNCA: Take care.	no

 FBOB: You too. [Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]	no

 RACH: What happened?	no

 MNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.	no

 MNCA: [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?	no

 JOEY: Hey.	no

 GANG: Hey!	no

 JOEY: It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.	no

 JOEY: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.	no

 ROSS: Good for you.	no

 PHOE: So... and?	no

 JOEY: Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!	no

 GANG: Allright!	no

 RUSS: Hi.	no

 PHOE: Hi.	no

 RUSS: I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.	no

 RUSS: Oh. [Julie... Ross's ex-girlfriend... enters.]	no

 JULIE: Hey.	no

 PHOE: Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?	no

 ROSS: Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!	no

 CAROL: So how did everything go?	no

 CAROL: Well, we've gotta go.	no

 ROSS: Ok.	no

 ROSS: Oh, you and me?	no

 CAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.	no

 ROSS: Ok.	no

 CAROL: We're uh, we're getting married.	no

 ROSS: As in, &quot;I now pronounce you wife and wife&quot; married?	no

 CAROL: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.	no

 ROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.	no

 CAROL: Look I just thought that...	no

 SUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?	no

 ROSS: Mmm hmmm.	no

 CAROL: Want us to go?	no

 ROSS: Uh-huh. [at Rachel and Monica's]	no

 MONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?	no

 ROSS: Would it matter?	no

 MONICA: Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!	no

 JOEY: Are you really not going?	no

 ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?	no

 ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.	no

 MONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.	no

 ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.	no

 CHANDLER: Whoa, she's pretty.	no

 RACHEL: I'm sorry, what?	no

 MONICA: What?	no

 CHANDLER: Oh, ok.	no

 JOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.	no

 CHANDLER: Nice!	no

 RACHEL: That's great!	no

 ROSS: Excellent!	no

 ROSS: That is so good! Do it again!	no

 JOEY: All right, all right. &quot;Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!&quot;	no

 ROSS: No no, that's me.	no

 CHANDLER: Oh, yeah.	no

 ROSS: Oh, hello.	no

 PHOEBE: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...	no

 ROSS: Is everything ok?	no

 ROSS: Oh my god.	no

 PHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.	no

 MONICA: Oh, honey.	no

 RACHEL: What do you mean?	no

 PHOEBE: I think it went into me. [Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe] [Central Perk]	no

 RACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?	no

 RACHEL: Oh god.	no

 JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?	no

 RACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. MRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross.	no

 RACHEL: Oh Mom! MRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.	no

 RACHEL: Really? MRS GREEN: Yes.	no

 JOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?	no

 PHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales? [at Rachel and Monica's MRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.	no

 RACHEL: For...me. MRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.	no

 RACHEL: Well, what do you mean? MRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.	no

 RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.	no

 ROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?	no

 RACHEL: None.	no

 JOEY: They didn't fight a lot?	no

 RACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?	no

 PHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.	no

 JOEY: Hey, look who's up.	no

 MONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.	no

 PHOEBE: That's him.	no

 PHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit? MR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?	no

 PHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? MR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.	no

 PHOEBE: Everything? MR A: Everything.	no

 PHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. MR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.	no

 MONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, &quot;thank you, but I don't really need your help&quot;?	no

 RACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, &quot;don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.&quot;	no

 RACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?	no

 MONICA: If you want.	no

 PHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.	no

 RACHEL: She's still with you?	no

 RACHEL: God!	no

 MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?	no

 MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.	no

 RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it? MRS GREEN: No.	no

 RACHEL: Then what? What do you want? MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.	no

 RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this? MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.	no

 RACHEL: Oh.	no

 MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!	no

 MONICA: Joey, speed it up!	no

 MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?	no

 PHOEBE: Sir! No sir!	no

 MONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!	no

 ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.	no

 MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called &quot;pigs in Ross&quot;. All right, ball the melon.	no

 CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. [knock at the door]	no

 MONICA: Hi.	no

 CAROL: How's it going?	no

 CAROL: Fine, whatever.	no

 ROSS: What's the matter?	no

 CAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.	no

 ROSS: What?	no

 MONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.	no

 ROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?	no

 ROSS: Oh my god.	no

 ROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.	no

 Rachel: He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.	no

 Monica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?	no

 Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.	no

 Rachel: Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?	no

 Chandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)	no

 Rachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?	no

 Monica: Hello?	no

 Monica: C'mon up.	no

 Joey: What's the matter with Rog?	no

 Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?	no

 Roger: I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...	no

 Monica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.	no

 Roger: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.	no

 Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!	no

 Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!	no

 Phoebe: Isn't he good?	no

 Ross: Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...	no

 Monica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!	no

 Roger: Oh. They don't.	no

 Phoebe: But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...	no

 Joey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? (Chandler and Joey leave the table.)	no

 Joey: Uh, we might be leaving now.	no

 Chandler: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.	no

 Chandler: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.	no

 Chandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.	no

 Chandler: Oh, no I don't.	no

 Chandler: I did, but...	no

 Carol: Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.	no

 Ross: Oh, what? What-what?	no

 Monica: The Luisa from home room!	no

 Luisa: You have no idea who I am, do you.	no

 Monica: No, none at all.	no

 Rachel: None.	no

 Luisa: Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?	no

 Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!	no

 Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch!	no

 Phoebe: Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!	no

 Joey: Her answer machine?	no

 Phoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?	no

 Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase &quot;Yes indeedy-o.&quot;	no

 Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!	no

 Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?	no

 Phoebe: Okay, they're just talking...	no

 Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?	no

 Phoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!	no

 Ross: What? What? What?!	no

 All: Oh!... Right!	no

 Chandler: Hey Rach!	no

 Rachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...	no

 Rachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!	no

 Ross: That's, that's nice twice!	no

 Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?	no

 Chandler: Yes!	no

 Rachel: Why?	no

 Chandler: I have my reasons.	no

 Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?	no

 Rachel: Wow... Wow!	no

 Barry: Yeah.	no

 Rachel: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.	no

 Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!	no

 Ross: What was with the dishes?	no

 Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.	no

 Monica: (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!	no

 Phoebe: Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!	no

 Monica: Great, now he's waving back.	no

 Monica: What kinda stuff?	no

 Phoebe: You cook naked?	no

 Joey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. (A pause as they look at Chandler.)	no

 Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.	no

 Barry: What's the matter?	no

 Rachel: Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.	no

 Barry: No, it was. It was very very good.	no

 Rachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..	no

 Bobby: Hey, Dr. Farber. (Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)	no

 Rachel: What?!	no

 Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?	no

 Joey: Maybe she never got your message.	no

 Phoebe: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.	no

 Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...	no

 Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?	no

 Phoebe: How many beeps?	no

 Chandler: She answered.	no

 All: Hey! Hi!	no

 Rachel: Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)	no

 Monica: (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?	no

 Ross: You-you had what?	no

 Phoebe: Sex in his chair.	no

 Rachel: I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.	no

 Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!	no

 Rachel: Please. If she said to you, &quot;Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,&quot; what would you say? (Ross flounders.)	no

 Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.	no

 Phoebe: Where are you going?	no

 Ross: (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay? (Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)	no

 Rachel: (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay.

 Rachel: Get down?	no

 Chandler: ...And boogie!	no

 Monica: Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.	no

 Rachel: Oh sure it is!	no

 Mindy: Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.	no

 Rachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?	no

 Rachel: (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.	no

 Mindy: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!	no

 Rachel: What? What's what you were afraid of?	no

 Mindy: Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.	no

 Rachel: What?	no

 Mindy: I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said &quot;Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,&quot; and now I feel so stupid.	no

 Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...	no

 Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.	no

 Rachel: So Pheebs, what is the book about?	no

 Phoebe: I thought you said you read it in high school.	no

 Rachel: Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. The Teacher: Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?	no

 Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character. The Teacher: Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here&
 Phoebe: (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!	no

 Rachel: Well, honey that was pretty obvious.	no

 Phoebe: Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it! The Teacher: What do you think? You in the blue shirt.	no

 Monica: Ross, are you okay?	no

 Ross: I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.	no

 Monica: Why?!	no

 Ross: He gave me a pill for it.	no

 Monica: A pill?	no

 Ross: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.	no

 Phoebe: (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.	no

 Rachel: That was not funny!	no

 Rachel: Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!	no

 Phoebe: Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.	no

 Joey: Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?	no

 Monica: Yes it's true.	no

 Rachel: Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?	no

 Ross: My God Monica!!	no

 Phoebe: So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.	no

 Phoebe: Wait, you can't take the money out. The Man: I'm making change. I need change for the bus.	no

 Phoebe: But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor. The Man: I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!	no

 Joey: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.	no

 Ross: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!	no

 Rachel: (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?	no

 Rachel: Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!	no

 Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!	no

 Joey: What-what is it, what is it?	no

 Rachel: Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.	no

 Joey: Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!	no

 Rachel: Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!	no

 Rachel: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?	no

 Elizabeth: Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.	no

 Phoebe: Yeah!	no

 Rachel: That really is something; that's really cool.	no

 Rachel: Hey, uh, Joey?	no

 Joey: Umm?	no

 Rachel: Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?	no

 Rachel: I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?	no

 Joey: Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!	no

 Joey: Now? You want me to go over there now?	no

 Rachel: Yeah!	no

 Rachel: Ohhh, yeah, me too. (They both exit.)	no

 Rachel: Come on Joey!!!	no

 Joey: Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.	no

 Joey: Hey Ross!	no

 Phoebe: Hey!	no

 All:  What? Oh!	no

 Chandler: Sorry man.	no

 Gunther: Here's your scone.	no

 Phoebe: Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?	no

 Rachel: Pheebs, I don&
 Phoebe: Exactly! Because it's in the past!	no

 Joey: (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?	no

 Monica: I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.	no

 Rachel: (To Monica) Hey!	no

 Monica: Hi!	no

 Rachel: What's up?!	no

 Monica: What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.	no

 Rachel: Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?	no

 Monica: Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.	no

 Rachel: Oh y'know what, we don&

 Ross: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.	no

 Joey: Really?	no

 Ross: Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.	no

 Chandler: Let them win one.	no

 Monica: They have racquets don't they?!	no

 Doug: Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.	no

 Chandler: Oopsey, missed it!	no

 Monica: I can't believe you let them win!	no

 Monica: I was frustrated.	no

 Chandler: It was my racquet.	no

 Monica: I was frustrated with you!	no

 Monica: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.	no

 Phoebe: Hey!	no

 Rachel: There he is!	no

 Ross: Just, y'know out.	no

 Phoebe: What were you doing?	no

 Rachel: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?	no

 Ross: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say&
 Ross: I am gonna see her again.	no

 Rachel: (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!	no

 Monica: My turn? What-what are you talking about?	no

 Monica: What?!	no

 Rachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, &quot;I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.&quot; And he said, &quot;Laundry? Is that my new nickname?&quot; And you said, &quot;No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.&quot;	no

 Joey: And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!	no

 Phoebe: (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!	no

 Joey: Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.	no

 Phoebe: Ohh, tough call.	no

 Joey: Yeah.	no

 Doug: But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)	no

 Kara: So how do you kids like your coffee?	no

 Monica: Oh, none for me. Thanks.	no

 Monica: (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?	no

 Chandler: Oh, you get used to it.	no

 Monica: Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.	no

 Chandler: So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?	no

 Chandler: What?	no

 Doug: The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?	no

 Doug: Excuse me?	no

 Chandler: Well, I just&

 Rachel: Okay.	no

 Monica: I'll get back to my new job. (Pause.)	no

 Gunther: Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)	no

 Janice: Actually, I should get going.	no

 Ross: Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?	no

 Janice: Yes! Yes! You did!	no

 Ross: Oh&
 Janice: What is wrong now?!	no

 Ross: This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then&
 Ross: Okay. Sometimes I feel&
 Janice: No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.	no

 Ross: Huh?	no

 Janice: Well yeah!!	no

 Ross: OH&
 Janice: Are you gonna be okay?	no

 Ross: I am now.	no

 Janice: Okay. (Joey enters.)	no

 Joey: Umm, hi.	no

 Ross: Dude, we got to talk.	no

 Chandler: Okay.	no

 Ross: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?	no

 Chandler: Why would I be mad?	no

 Ross: Okay.	no

 Ross: All right.	no

 Monica: That was a half an hour?	no

 Monica: Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!	no

 Chandler: Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!	no

 Monica: It's so good, isn't it?	no

 Monica: Say good-bye to sore muscles!	no

 Chandler: I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just&
 Ross: Sorry.	no

 Ross: (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.	no

 Joey: Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.	no

 Joey: Great! Thanks, Rach!	no

 Rachel: Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!	no

 Joey: All right. (Both of them remove their hats as Phoebe enters.)	no

 Ross: Hey Pheebs, how's it going?	no

 Chandler: Hey.	no

 Rachel: What?	no

 Ross: Is everything okay?	no

 Joey: Are you all right?	no

 Phoebe: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.	no

 Joey: Pheebs! Sorry!	no

 Rachel: Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?	no

 Ross: Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.	no

 Monica: Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.	no

 Monica: (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?	no

 Phoebe: Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.	no

 Joey: Pheebs, I'm so sorry.	no

 Phoebe: It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; &quot;Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter.&quot; And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.	no

 Joey: All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.	no

 Rachel: Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)	no

 Joey: Really? A purse?	no

 Rachel: It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.	no

 Joey: It looks like a women's purse.	no

 Joey: See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.	no

 Rachel: Exactly! Unisex!	no

 Phoebe: It's Phoebe.	no

 Phoebe: Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?	no

 Phoebe: Umm, well, umm Grandma died.	no

 Joey: Hey!	no

 Rachel: (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.	no

 Rachel: Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.	no

 Joey: Why would I return it? I love this bag!	no

 Rachel: (glaring at him) Joey&
 Ross: What's the part, Anti-man?	no

 Rachel: Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.	no

 Rachel: Hi sweetie!	no

 Ross: Hey, how are you holding up?	no

 Joey: Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.	no

 Monica: Oh, did you catch him?!	no

 Phoebe: Uh-huh.	no

 Ross: Wh-what did he say?!	no

 Phoebe: He said, &quot;Nice to meet you Glenda.&quot; (They stare at her, dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?	no

 Rachel: Why?! Why not?!	no

 Joey: What did you say to him?	no

 Phoebe: All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.	no

 Rachel: Okay.	no

 Joey: (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?	no

 Rachel: Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.	no

 Phoebe: All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.	no

 Rachel: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?	no

 Phoebe: Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out	no

 Monica: Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.	no

 Phoebe: Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!	no

 Monica: What are you talking about?	no

 Phoebe: (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!	no

 Monica: No he's not!	no

 Chandler: (wincing) Yes, he is!	no

 Monica: What?!	no

 Chandler: I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!	no

 Monica: You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.	no

 Ross: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.	no

 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is poking his head in.]	no

 Monica: No.	no

 Monica: Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me&
 Chandler: Okay, but now see you're crying!	no

 Monica: I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.	no

 Chandler: What?	no

 Monica: (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.	no

 Chandler: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.	no

 Monica: Oh my God! You don't know me at all!	no

 Chandler: Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.	no

 Monica: I'm crying here!!	no

 Chandler: Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!	no

 Monica: So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?	no

 Chandler: Absolutely!	no

 Monica: Okay. I suck!	no

 Chandler: Yeah! (They hug.)	no

 Phoebe: Okay. Frank Sr.: So, what did Francis leave me?	no

 Phoebe: Huh? Frank Sr.: Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?	no

 Phoebe: But you-you-you came to see Lilly? Frank Sr.: Yeah, yeah. Why?	no

 Phoebe: Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.) Frank Sr.: She what?!	no

 Phoebe: She's dead. Frank Sr.: Are you sure?	no

 Phoebe: 17 years ago. Frank Sr.: Oh! What about, what about the girls?	no

 Phoebe: Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, (pause) is on this couch. (Silence ensues.)	no

 Joey: (dejected) Hi.	no

 All: Hey!	no

 Chandler: Hey man, how did the audition go?	no

 Rachel: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!	no

 Ross: What kind of problem?	no

 Joey: Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!	no

 Monica: Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.	no

 Chandler: Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)	no

 Rachel: &
 Joey: I can't believe I'm hearing this!	no

 Rachel: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn&
 Rachel: I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.	no

 Ross: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.	no

 Rachel: Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.	no

 Ross: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!	no

 All: Good idea! Yes!	no

 Ross: It would be so cool to live across from you guys!	no

 Ross: Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!	no

 Ross: (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)	no

 Rachel: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)	no

 Rachel: What?!	no

 Phoebe: (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!	no

 Rachel: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.	no

 Joey: (entering) Hey guys!	no

 Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!	no

 Joey: What? What?	no

 Rachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.	no

 Joey: You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)	no

 Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?	no

 Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?	no

 Phoebe: Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.	no

 Rachel: Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!	no

 Joey: No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.	no

 Rachel: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.	no

 Joey: I can't take any&

 Monica: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?	no

 Monica: What?	no

 Monica: What are you talking about?	no

 Chandler: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.	no

 Monica: That's not possible!	no

 Monica: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.	no

 Rachel: Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?	no

 Monica: Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.	no

 Chandler: Sure, I'll do it with ya.	no

 Monica: Okay.	no

 Ross: (entering) Hey!	no

 Rachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?	no

 Ross: Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.	no

 Rachel: Oh.	no

 Ross: No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window. (They all head to the window.)	no

 Monica: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?	no

 Ross: No.	no

 Ross: No.	no

 Ross: A basket of mini-muffins.	no

 Ross: The small one.	no

 Rachel: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?	no

 Ross: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.	no

 Ross: Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)	no

 Chandler: Oh man!	no

 Monica: Unless&
 Joey: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!	no

 Rachel: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!	no

 Phoebe: Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?	no

 Ross: Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!	no

 Rachel: Y'know what you should do?	no

 Ross: Huh?	no

 Rachel: (To Ross) See?	no

 Ross: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.	no

 Phoebe: He broke that.	no

 Rachel: Yeah, he broke those too.	no

 Phoebe: I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.	no

 Rachel: Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.	no

 Phoebe: (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.	no

 Rachel: Are you kidding?!	no

 Joey: No.	no

 Rachel: Joey!	no

 Joey: They know you know.	no

 Phoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!	no

 Monica: Oh yeah! [Cut to Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.]	no

 Phoebe: All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.	no

 Rachel: All right. Be sexy.	no

 Phoebe: So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.	no

 Rachel: Show time!	no

 Phoebe: Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!	no

 Rachel: Okay! (She runs to get some.)	no

 Chandler: You look good.	no

 Phoebe: Really?	no

 Chandler: Oh, do you not want to?	no

 Chandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!	no

 Monica: She's bluffing!	no

 Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.) [Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]	no

 [Scene: Ross's apartment, he's having his party, only he's the only guest. He gets up and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it. So he takes it off and puts on one that says Dr. Geller and he puts the Ross one underneath the Dr. Geller one. Then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for Howard raging in the apartment across the hall.] Party Guests: (chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!

 Rachel: I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &amp; Order!	no

 Phoebe: I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?	no

 Rachel: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.	no

 Chandler: The one that doesn't.	no

 Monica: That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.	no

 Chandler: Okay.	no

 Monica: (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!	no

 Phoebe: But I like it here!	no

 Phoebe: Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.	no

 Chandler: Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.	no

 Caitlin: I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)	no

 Chandler: You're welcome.	no

 Chandler: Really?!	no

 Monica: It's no big deal, I do it all the time.	no

 Monica: Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!	no

 Chandler: Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.	no

 Monica: Chandler, this actually bothers you?	no

 Chandler: Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?	no

 Joey: No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me. Grandma Tribbiani: No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.	no

 Phoebe: But I already gave them back to you!	no

 Monica: No you didn't.	no

 Phoebe: All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?	no

 Phoebe: (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!	no

 Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.	no

 Phoebe: All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.	no

 Phoebe: Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?	no

 Monica: Yeah, what is it?	no

 Monica: (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.	no

 Rachel: Yeah.	no

 Caitlin: The guy with the gas?!	no

 Caitlin: Really?!	no

 Rachel: Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?	no

 Caitlin: I just, I thought Joey was there.	no

 Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.	no

 Ross: What do you mean?	no

 Rachel: Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)	no

 Ross: And she just gave you this?	no

 Rachel: Yeah!	no

 Monica: Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.	no

 Joey: Oh, yeah, good idea. (Ross returns.)	no

 Chandler: Hey man, what's up?	no

 Ross: (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.)	no

 Monica: Phoebe?	no

 Phoebe: What?	no

 Monica: Do you have a plan?	no

 Rachel: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!	no

 Phoebe: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.	no

 Monica: Oh, no...	no

 Monica: Light still out?	no

 Rachel: Yeah.	no

 Monica: Oh. Maybe they're- napping.	no

 Rachel: Oh please, they're having sex. Monica and Phoebe: Shut up!	no

 Monica: I think he's shy.	no

 Phoebe: Yeah?	no

 Monica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.	no

 Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.	no

 Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated...	no

 Chandler: Then what?	no

 Joey: What?	no

 Ross: It was my first time.	no

 Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)	no

 Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.	no

 Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.	no

 Joey: No plans, huh?	no

 Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up.	no

 Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.	no

 Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.	no

 Phoebe: (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?	no

 Rachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.	no

 Ross: That guy, he burns me up.	no

 Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.	no

 Monica: Did he give you that whole &quot;You're-not-up-to-this&quot; thing again?	no

 Angela: Hi, Joey.	no

 Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?	no

 Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.	no

 Angela: (casually) Joey.	no

 Joey: You look good.	no

 Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?	no

 Rachel: Who?	no

 Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?	no

 Rachel: Sure. (Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)	no

 Angela: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.	no

 Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?	no

 Joey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.	no

 Angela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?	no

 Monica: (looking out window) Oh, god help us.	no

 Joey: What?	no

 Ross: (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.	no

 Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?	no

 Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.	no

 Chandler: Yuh-huh.	no

 Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?	no

 Chandler: There you go.	no

 Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?	no

 Joey: Yep.	no

 Monica: Which?	no

 Joey: Which what?	no

 Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?	no

 Joey: No, but he's...	no

 Angela: Hey, Joey.	no

 Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?	no

 Chandler: Here we go.	no

 Chandler: Hey, Janice.	no

 Janice: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.	no

 Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?	no

 Chandler: What?	no

 Janice: What?	no

 Chandler: (covering) What... did you get me there?	no

 Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?	no

 Chandler: That's it?	no

 Phoebe: Yeah, it was really hard.	no

 Chandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.	no

 Phoebe: Ok, you weren't there.	no

 Rachel: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.	no

 Rachel: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.	no

 Rachel: What?	no

 Rachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.	no

 Ross: Was your basket on top?	no

 Rachel: Yeah, but, there were no suds.	no

 Ross: So?	no

 Rachel: Well, you know, no suds, no save.	no

 Rachel: What's that?	no

 Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?	no

 Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?	no

 Rachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.	no

 Monica: (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?	no

 Joey: Oh my god.	no

 Monica: What?	no

 Joey: So, you and Angela, huh?	no

 Joey: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.	no

 Joey: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.	no

 Angela: Yeah, isn't he?	no

 Angela: You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.	no

 Monica: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.	no

 Angela: Huh. That's nice.	no

 Chandler: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.	no

 Rachel: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.	no

 Rachel: What uh-oh?	no

 Rachel: Ross, what's the matter?	no

 Rachel: Come on, show me.	no

 Ross: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.	no

 Rachel: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry! (The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and laughs.)	no

 Monica: Oh my god.	no

 Joey: What?	no

 Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's&
 Joey: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...	no

 Monica: Oh my god, what were you thinking?	no

 Monica: (hits him lightly) Oh!	no

 Joey: Ow!	no

 Monica: (leaving) I'm outta here.	no

 Joey: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.	no

 Monica: Really?	no

 Joey: Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.	no

 Janice: Ow!	no

 Chandler: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?	no

 Janice: Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back. (She leaves.)	no

 Chandler: I'm fine.	no

 Phoebe: All right. (Janice returns from the bathroom.)	no

 Chandler: I'm not fine. Here she comes.	no

 Chandler: How do you do that?	no

 Phoebe: It's like a gift.	no

 Phoebe: Oh, I'd like that.	no

 Ross: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.	no

 Rachel: Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.	no

 Rachel: I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.	no

 Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it! (She thinks it over, and then walks away.)	no

 Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?	no

 Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.	no

 Monica: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.	no

 Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?	no

 Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?	no

 Phoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?	no

 Ross: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.	no

 Joey: I couldn't do it.	no

 Monica: Good for you, Joey.	no

 Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- (They all pretend to fall asleep.)	no

 Ross: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.	no

 Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!	no

 Rachel: Tah-daaah!	no

 Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.	no

 Monica: How-how did that happen?	no

 Rachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.	no

 Phoebe: (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.	no

 Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!	no

 Phoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!	no

 Monica: That is so unfair!	no

 Monica: Why not?	no

 Monica: I could do that.	no

 Monica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.	no

 Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?	no

 Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! (Joey enters and he's on the phone.)	no

 Monica: Well, what's the part?	no

 Chandler: Lose the other guys.	no

 Aurora: ...Like, ...all of them?	no

 Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?	no

 Chandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'	no

 Aurora: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?	no

 Chandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...	no

 Aurora: Which one?	no

 Chandler: ...The second guy.	no

 Aurora: (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind. (She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)	no

 Chandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips. (She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)	no

 Joey: Nope.	no

 Ross: No? What happened, big guy?	no

 Joey: I got fired.	no

 Rachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.	no

 Chandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.	no

 Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!	no

 Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.	no

 Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?	no

 Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.) (Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)	no

 Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.	no

 Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?	no

 Ross: Shhhh!	no

 Rachel: What are you shushing?	no

 Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?	no

 Ross: See?	no
